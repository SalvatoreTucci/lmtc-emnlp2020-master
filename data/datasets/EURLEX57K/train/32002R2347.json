After the sea trip has concluded, the vessel must not leave the port until the satellite tracking device is functioning to the satisfaction of the competent authorities.\n3. Repeated instances of non-compliance with the obligations laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be considered as conduct that seriously infringes the Common Fisheries Policy, according to Council Regulation (EC) 1447/1999, of 24 June 1999, establishing a list of types of behaviour which seriously infringe the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy(10).\n4.
