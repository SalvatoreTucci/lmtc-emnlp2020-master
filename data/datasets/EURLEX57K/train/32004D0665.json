Such information is not available and therefore a special study should be carried out in order to monitor the prevalence of salmonella in laying hens during an appropriate period of time in order to take into account possible seasonal variations.\n(3) Article 19 of Decision 90/424/EEC laid down that the Community shall undertake, or assist the Member States in undertaking, the technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and for the development of veterinary education and training.\n(4) The study will provide technical information necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation. In light of the importance to collect comparable data on the prevalence of salmonella in laying hens in Member States, the Community should provide financial assistance to the Member States in the implementation of the specific requirements of the study. It is appropriate to reimburse 100\u00a0% of the costs incurred for the laboratory testing, up to a maximum amount per test.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 3(2), of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999\u00a0(3), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; for financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(6) A financial contribution from the Community should be granted in so far as the actions provided for are effectively carried out and provided that the authorities furnish all the necessary information within the time limits provided for.\n(7) There is a need to clarify the rate to be used for the conversion of the payment applications submitted in national currency as defined in Article 1(d) of Council Regulation (EC) 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro\u00a0(4).\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Objective of the study and general provisions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall undertake a technical study aiming at estimating across the European Union the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in flocks of laying hens (Gallus gallus) for table egg production at the end of their production period (hereafter the study).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The results shall be used to set Community targets as provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The study shall cover a one-year period commencing from 1 October 2004.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of this decision \u2018competent authority\u2019 shall mean the authority or authorities of a Member State as provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of paragraph 1, the Commission and the Member States shall cooperate in accordance with Articles 2 to 6.", "Sampling frame\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling for the purpose of carrying out the study shall be organised by the Member States and shall be performed from 1 October 2004 in holdings containing at least 1\u00a0000 laying hens.
