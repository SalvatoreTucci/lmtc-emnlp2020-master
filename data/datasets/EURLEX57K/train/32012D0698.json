A study has confirmed the feasibility of warehousing as an effective tool for establishing the means of rapid deployment of physical assets required by civilian crisis management missions.\n(4) In January 2010, a temporary solution for the storage of assets required for civilian crisis management missions was found by storing surplus equipment within the premises of the European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the moment, assets which allow 200 staff to deploy in a new mission are also stored within those premises. However, due to the temporary nature of this arrangement, a longer term solution needs to be found.\n(5) In accordance with the chain of command in civilian crisis management missions, the Civilian Operation Commander, in cooperation with the Commission, needs to be able to ensure that the rapid deployment needs and operational requirements of the civilian crisis management missions are met.\n(6) To that end, the Council emphasised in its Conclusions on ESDP of 17 November 2009 that a permanent capacity to store new and existing strategic material is a vital resource to ensure rapid deployment of equipment to new and existing missions, as well as ensuring sound financial management. Such a warehouse should be established through a procurement procedure resulting in a contract between the Commission and the warehouse operator. The Commission has prepared appropriate terms of reference for the procurement procedure, in cooperation with the European External Action Service (EEAS),", "main_body": ["Objectives\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of ensuring the rapid deployment of equipment to existing and future civilian crisis management missions, the Union shall strengthen its capabilities, in particular by seeking to ensure quick and continuous access to key assets.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, the Union shall take appropriate measures to improve the deployment and functioning of its ongoing and future civilian crisis management missions through the establishment of a warehouse with a capacity to store new and used equipment for such missions.", "Establishment of a warehouse\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes set out in Article 1, a warehouse shall be established.
