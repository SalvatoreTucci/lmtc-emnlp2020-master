It has emerged on the illicit amphetamine market where it is sold and used as the controlled drug, amphetamine. There has been one report of the substance being detected in a commercial product sold on the internet. The main chemical precursor for the synthesis of 4-methylamphetamine is 4-methylbenzyl methyl ketone (4-methyl-BMK), which appears to be commercially available on the internet and is not controlled under the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.\n(3) The specific physical effects of 4-methylamphetamine have been rarely reported by users, since users are typically unaware that they have taken the substance. However, the few reports that are available suggest that it has stimulant-type effects. Limited data available relating to humans suggest that the adverse effects of 4-methylamphetamine include hyperthermia, hypertension, anorexia, nausea, perspiration, gastric distress, coughing, vomiting, headache, palpitations, insomnia, paranoia, anxiety and depression. Current data is not sufficient to determine the relative dependence-producing potential of the substance.\n(4) According to the limited data sources available, the acute toxicity of 4-methylamphetamine is similar to that of other stimulants. Certain evidence suggests that a combination of 4-methylamphetamine with other substances, including amphetamine and caffeine, may result in a higher risk of overall enhanced toxicity.\n(5) There have been a total of 21 fatalities registered in four Member States where 4-methylamphetamine alone, or in combination with one or more substances, especially amphetamine, has been detected in post-mortem samples. While it is not possible to determine with certainty from the information available the role of 4-methylamphetamine in those fatalities, in some cases the substance was the predominant drug detected, with levels comparable to those found in certain cases of death caused by the consumption of amphetamine.\n(6) 4-methylamphetamine has been detected in 15 Member States, while one Member State has reported the manufacture of the substance on its territory. Prevalence specific to 4-methylamphetamine is difficult to estimate. There is no information on specific demand for the substance from user groups and it is not commercially marketed through internet shops.\n(7) The information available suggests that 4-methylamphetamine is produced and distributed by the same organised crime groups that are involved in the manufacture and trafficking of amphetamine.\n(8) 4-methylamphetamine has no known, established or acknowledged medical value or use in the Union and there is no marketing authorisation for the substance in the Union. Apart from its use as an analytical reference standard and in scientific research, there is no indication that it may be used for any other legitimate purpose.\n(9) 4-methylamphetamine is not currently under assessment and has not been under assessment by the United Nations system. Eight Member States control the substance under drug control legislation by virtue of their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Two other Member States apply the generic definition of phenethylamine in their national legislation to the product while one Member State controls it under its medicines legislation.\n(10) The risk assessment report reveals that there is limited scientific evidence available on the characteristics and risks of 4-methylamphetamine and points out that further studies are required on the overall health and social risks associated with the substance. However, the evidence available provides sufficient grounds for subjecting 4-methylamphetamine to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health risks it poses, as documented in its detection in several reported fatalities, especially when used in combination with other substances; its strong resemblance in terms of appearance and effects with amphetamine; the fact that users may unknowingly consume the substance and its limited medical value or use, 4-methylamphetamine should be subjected to control measures across the Union.\n(11) Since 10 Member States already control 4-methylamphetamine, subjecting it to control measures across the Union may help avoid problems in cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation.\n(12) Union-wide control measures may also help prevent 4-methylamphetamine developing as an alternative to amphetamine in the illicit drug markets,", "main_body": ["The new psychoactive substance, 4-methylamphetamine, is hereby subjected to control measures across the Union.", "By 17 March 2014, Member States shall take the necessary measures, in accordance with their national law, to subject 4-methylamphetamine to control measures and criminal penalties, as provided for under their legislation complying with their obligations under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 March 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
