Council Regulation (EC) No 344/96\u00a0(3) consequently incorporated into the Combined Nomenclature a subheading 2309\u00a090\u00a020 to classify this product separately.\n(3) As the result of an omission, Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals\u00a0(4) was not adapted accordingly. This adaptation must therefore be made, with effect from the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003, by incorporating code CN 2309\u00a090\u00a020 into the list of products included in Annex I to that Regulation.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for cereals,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 July 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 34, 9.2.1979, p. 2.
