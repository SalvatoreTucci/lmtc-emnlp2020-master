Directive 97/68/EC provided that emission limits applicable to type-approval of the majority of compression ignition engines under Stage III A were to be replaced by the more stringent limits under Stage III B. Those limits apply from 1 January 2010 as regards the type-approval for those engines and from 1 January 2011 with regard to the placing on the market of those engines.\n(2) The revision of Directive 97/68/EC is currently being prepared by the Commission in line with the requirements of Article 2 of Directive 2004/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC\u00a0(4). In order to ensure that the revised Directive is in line with Union standards for good air quality, and in the light of experience, scientific findings and available technologies, the Commission should, in the upcoming revision of Directive 97/68/EC and subject to impact assessment, consider:\n\u2014 establishing a new emission stage \u2013 Stage V \u2013 that should be based, subject to technical feasibility, on the requirements of Euro VI standards for heavy-duty vehicles,\n\u2014 introducing new requirements for the reduction of particulate matter, namely a particulate number limit that applies for all compression ignition engine categories, where technically feasible, so as to ensure an effective reduction of ultra-fine particles,\n\u2014 taking a comprehensive approach to promoting emission-reducing provisions and retrofitting of after-treatment systems on the existing fleet of non-road mobile machinery on the basis of the currently ongoing discussions under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe regarding harmonised requirements for retrofit emission control devices; this approach should support Member States\u2019 efforts to improve air quality and to promote the protection of workers,\n\u2014 establishing a method providing for the periodic testing of non-road mobile machinery and vehicles, in particular to establish whether their emissions performance complies with the values given at registration,\n\u2014 the possibility of authorising, under certain conditions, replacement engines that do not comply with Stage III A requirements for railcars and locomotives,\n\u2014 the possibility of harmonising the specific emission standards for rail with relevant standards at international level so as to ensure the availability of affordable engines that comply with the emission limits set.\n(3) The transition to Stage III B involves a step change in technology requiring significant implementation costs for redesigning the engines and for developing advanced technical solutions. However, the current global financial and economic crisis or any conjunctural economic fluctuations should not lead to a lowering of environmental standards. This revision of Directive 97/68/EC should therefore be considered to be exceptional. Furthermore, investments in environmentally friendly technologies are important for the promotion of future growth, jobs and health security.\n(4) Directive 97/68/EC provides for a flexibility scheme to allow equipment manufacturers to purchase, in the period between two emission stages, a limited number of engines that do not comply with the emission limits applicable during that period, but which are approved in accordance with the requirements of the stage immediately preceding the applicable one.\n(5) Point (b) of Article 2 of Directive 2004/26/EC provides for the evaluation of the possible need for additional flexibilities.\n(6) During Stage III B, the maximum number of engines used for applications other than the propulsion of railcars, locomotives and inland waterways vessels that may be placed on the market under the flexibility scheme should be increased, in each engine category, from 20\u00a0% to 37,5\u00a0% of the annual quantity of equipment with engines in that category that is placed on the market by the equipment manufacturer. An optional alternative of placing a fixed number of engines on the market under the flexibility scheme should be available. That fixed number of engines should also be revised and should not exceed the ceilings laid down in Section 1.2.2 of Annex XIII to Directive 97/68/EC.\n(7) The rules applicable to the flexibility scheme should be adapted to extend the application of that scheme to engines for use in the propulsion of locomotives for a strictly limited period of time.\n(8) Improving air quality is a major Union goal pursued through Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe\u00a0(5). Tackling emissions at source is essential for meeting that goal, including reducing emissions from the non-road mobile machinery sector.\n(9) Enterprises operating with machines that fall within the scope of this Directive should benefit from European financial support programmes or any relevant support programmes provided by Member States. Those support programmes should be aimed at favouring the early introduction of the highest emission standards.\n(10) Directive 97/68/EC provides for an exemption for replacement engines, which does not apply to railcars and locomotives. However, considering weight and dimensional constraints, it is necessary to provide for a limited exemption also for replacement engines in railcars and locomotives.\n(11) The measures set out in this Directive reflect a temporary difficulty faced by the manufacturing sector, resulting in no permanent adaptation, and as such, the application of those measures should be restricted to the duration of Stage III B or, where no subsequent stage exists, to 3 years.\n(12) Taking into account the special infrastructure of the United Kingdom rail network, which results in a different structural gauge and consequently weight and dimensional constraints, and therefore requires a longer adaptation period for the new emission limits, it is appropriate to provide for more flexibility for this particular market in engines for use in locomotives.\n(13) Directive 97/68/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Directive 97/68/EC\nDirective 97/68/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) Article 4(6) is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 10 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 1a, the second subparagraph is deleted;\n(b) the following paragraphs are inserted:\n(a) replacement engines that meet the Stage III A limits, where they are to replace engines for railcars and locomotives that:\n(i) do not meet the Stage III A standard; or\n(ii) meet the Stage III A standard but do not meet the Stage III B standard;\n(b) replacement engines that do not meet Stage III A limits, where they are to replace engines for railcars without driving control and not capable of independent movement, so long as such replacement engines meet a standard no lower than the standard met by engines fitted to existing railcars of the same type.\n(c) paragraph 7 is replaced by the following:\n(3) Annex XIII is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 24 November 2012 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
