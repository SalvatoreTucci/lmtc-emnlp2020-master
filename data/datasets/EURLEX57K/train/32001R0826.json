The subsequent epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has made certain further amendments necessary.\n(2) By derogating from Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000, Article 1(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 590/2001 provides for the buying-in of five-rib forequarters. In the light of experience, certain rules on the takeover of the quarters should be established.\n(3) Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 590/2001 provides, for the first two tendering procedures of the second quarter of 2001, the possibility of buying in carcasses weighing more than the maximum weight while restricting in that case the buying-in price to that of the maximum authorised weight. In order to clarify the situation with regard to the purchase of forequarters, a restriction should be applied relating to the second tendering procedure by limiting their buying-in price to 40 % of the maximum payable weight for carcasses.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 590/2001 should therefore be amended.\n(5) In view of the development of events this Regulation must enter into force immediately.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 590/2001 is amended as follows:\n1.
