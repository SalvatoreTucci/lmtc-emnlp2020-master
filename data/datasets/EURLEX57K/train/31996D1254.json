Whereas, by its very nature, energy must be produced, distributed and used as rationally as possible with a view to sustainable development and whereas the capacity to develop renewable energy resources in the regions concerned must in no way be hindered or held back;\n2. Whereas the establishment and development of trans-European energy networks contribute towards attaining major objectives of the Community, such as completion of the internal market and the strengthening of economic and social cohesion;\n3. Whereas the establishment and development of trans-European energy networks throughout the territory of the Community also have the specific objectives of increasing the reliability and security of the Community's energy supplies and of allowing balanced operation of the internal energy market and an improvement in the Community's competitiveness;\n4. Whereas efforts must be made, in the planning, development and construction of the links currently missing from the trans-European networks for the transport of energy products, to ensure that these links are as short as possible and optimally sited, taking economic and environmental factors into account;\n5. Whereas, in order to contribute towards attaining the said objectives, the development of interconnections of electricity and natural gas transmission networks in the Community must be accelerated, particularly in the regions where improvements to the networks are necessary or in regions which are still isolated, and with the third countries in Europe and in the Mediterranean region;\n6. Whereas, in order to complete the internal market in energy, measures must be incorporated in an overall energy strategy which not only specifies the main criteria and objectives of the Community in this field but also defines more particularly the conditions for liberalizing the market in energy products;\n7. Whereas the interconnection of electricity and gas networks with third countries which are signatories to the Energy Charter Treaty (5) must be carried out in accordance with that Treaty;\n8. Whereas action by the Community to establish guidelines on trans-European energy networks is necessary, subject to the principle of subsidiarity;\n9. Whereas, in order to develop these networks on a Community-wide scale, it is necessary to identify projects of common interest and to create a more favourable context for the completion and interoperability of these networks;\n10. Whereas projects of common interest must meet the said objectives and form part of the said priorities; whereas only those projects should be considered which display potential economic viability, taking into account economic, social and technical factors; whereas, in this context, the concept of viability includes not only the financial profitability of the projects but also other considerations such as the reliability and security of energy supplies, the strengthening of economic and social cohesion and protection of the environment in the Community;\n11. Whereas private capital is used and will continue to be used in a majority of projects in the energy sector; whereas this means that the identification of projects of common interest will have to take particular account of the need to avoid distortions of competition;\n12. Whereas the guidelines identifying projects of common interest for the purposes of Article 129c (1), first indent, of the Treaty shall be adopted in accordance with Article 129d, first and second paragraphs;\n13. Whereas the projects of common interest should be identified by means of a sufficiently precise description; whereas a list of these projects and the description thereof as it appears in the Annex are therefore the most appropriate way of identifying them for the purposes of Article 129c of the Treaty;\n14. Whereas the procedure laid down in Article 129d, first and second paragraphs, of the Treaty is also applicable where the list of projects is to be extended or reduced;\n15. Whereas the Commission shall be responsible for laying down the specifications of the projects, which shall not affect their trans-European dimension;\n16. Whereas the Commission shall be responsible for updating projects without that process being allowed to affect the identity of a project in its trans-European dimension.\n17. Whereas the Commission shall be assisted by a committee;\n18. Whereas a modus vivendi was concluded on 20 December 1994 (6) between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concerning the implementing measures for acts adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty,", "main_body": ["Purpose\nThis Decision defines the nature and scope of Community action to establish guidelines for trans-European energy networks. It establishes a series of guidelines covering the objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures by the Community in respect of trans-European energy networks. These guidelines identify projects of common interest among trans-European electricity and natural gas networks.", "Scope\nThis Decision applies:\n1. in electricity networks, to:\n- all high-voltage lines, excluding those of distribution networks, and submarine links, provided this infrastructure is used for inter-regional or international transmission,\n- any equipment or installations essential for the system in question to operate properly, including protection, monitoring and control systems;\n2. in natural gas networks, to:\n- high-pressure gas pipelines, excluding those of distribution networks, making it possible to supply regions of the Community from internal or external sources,\n- underground storage facilities connected to the above-mentioned high-pressure gas pipelines,\n- reception, storage and regasification facilities for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and also gas carriers according to the capacities to be supplied,\n- any equipment or installations essential for the system in question to operate properly, including protection, monitoring and control systems.", "Objectives\nThe Community shall promote the interconnection, interoperability and development of trans-European energy networks and access to such networks in accordance with current Community law, with the aim of:\n- allowing effective operation of the internal market in general and of the internal energy market in particular, while encouraging the rational production, distribution and utilization of energy resources and the development of renewable energy resources, so as to reduce the cost of energy to the consumer and render the European economy more competitive,\n- facilitating the development and reducing the isolation of the less-favoured regions of the Community, thereby helping to strengthen economic and social cohesion,\n- reinforcing the security of energy supplies, for example by strengthening relations with third countries in the energy sector in their mutual interest, in particular in the framework of the Energy Charter Treaty and cooperation agreements concluded by the Community.", "Priorities\nThe priorities for action by the Community on trans-European energy networks shall be as follows:\n1. for electricity networks:\n- the connection of isolated electricity networks to the interconnected European networks (a),\n- the development of interconnections between Member States (b) and of internal connections insofar as necessary in order to make the best use of these interconnections (c),\n- the development of interconnections with third countries in Europe and the Mediterranean region which contribute to improving the reliability and security of the Community's electricity networks or to supplying the Community with electricity (d);\n2. for natural gas networks:\n- the introduction of natural gas into new regions (e),\n- the connection of isolated gas networks to the interconnected European networks, including the improvements needed to the existing networks for this purpose and the connection of the separate natural gas networks (f),\n- increasing the transmission (gas delivery pipelines) (h), reception (LNG) and storage (g) capacities needed to satisfy demand, and diversification of supply sources and routes for natural gas.", "Lines of action\nThe broad lines of action by the Community on trans-European energy networks shall be:\n- the identification of projects of common interest,\n- the creation of a more favourable context for development of these networks, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 129d of the Treaty.", "Criteria\n1.
