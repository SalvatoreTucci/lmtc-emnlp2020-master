Definition\nThe dried grapes must be of the sultana or muscatel varieties or currants grown from Vitis vinifera L.\n2. Minimum requirements\n2.1. The dried grapes must be:\n- whole,\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- free from living insects or mites whatever their stage of development,\n- free from abnormal external moisture,\n- free of foreign smell and taste (a slight smell of S02 and a slight smell and taste of oil are not considered abnormal),\n- and subject to the tolerances,\n- clean, practically free from any visible foreign matter,\n- free from visible damage by insects, mites or other parasites,\n- free from mould,\n- free from immature and/or undeveloped berries,\n- free from pieces of stem,\n- free from pedicels, except for muscatel,\n- free from damaged berries (in seeded forms, normal mechanical injury resulting from normal seeding operations is not considered \"damage\")\n- free from evident sugar crystals,\n- free from extraneous vegetable matter.\n2.2. The dried grapes must also:\n- possess similar varietal characteristics,\n- have a fairly good characteristic flavour, texture and colour,\n- be prepared from fairly well matured grapes,\n- be screened or sized,\n- they may have defects within the tolerance limits indicated under the provisions concerning tolerances provided that the dried grapes retain their essential characteristics as regards general appearance, quality, keeping quality and presentation.\n2.3. The condition of the dried grapes must be such as to enable them\n- to withstand transport and handling, and\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\n3. Moisture content\nThe dried grapes must have a moisture content of not less than 13 % and not more than 31 % for the Malaga/muscatel type, 23 % for seed-bearing varieties and 18 % for seedless varieties and currants.\n4. Tolerances\nThe tolerances in respect of quality allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements for the class indicated are as follows:\nSEEDLESS\n>TABLE>\nSEED-BEARING\n>TABLE>\nCURRANTS\n>TABLE>"}
