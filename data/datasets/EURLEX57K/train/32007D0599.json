However, when preparing their draft multi-annual programmes for 2007 to 2013, Member States should allocate the available Community resources under this Fund to at least three of the five priorities listed below.\nThe specific priorities listed below refer to national actions which either add to the value of common instruments and tools for practitioners or have a direct impact on the capacity of other Member States or the Community as a whole to secure the external borders.\nMoreover, when drafting their multi-annual programmes, Member States are invited to take into account the synergies with the work undertaken by the Frontex Agency on the control and surveillance of external borders.\nPRIORITY 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0support for the further gradual establishment of the common integrated border management system as regards the checks on persons at and the surveillance of the external borders.\nThis could involve investment in infrastructure, systems and equipment within the framework of the eligibility rules of the Fund. These investments should aim in particular at ensuring convergence in information management in order to facilitate decision making and information sharing between Member States and also at improving architecture and processes for further enhancing border security, including provision of forgery detection equipment.\nWithin this priority, the Community contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for projects addressing the following specific priorities:\n(1) upgrading of the national communication systems to make them interoperable with other Member States;\n(2) purchase and/or upgrading of operating equipment to control external borders which is interoperable with other Member States and takes into account the results of the common integrated risk analysis;\n(3) purchase and/or upgrading of operating equipment in order to increase the capacity of Member States to take part in and/or contribute to operational cooperation between Member States as coordinated by the Frontex Agency.\nPRIORITY 2:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0support for the development and implementation of the national components of a European Surveillance System for the external borders and of a permanent European Patrol Network at the southern maritime borders of the EU Member States.\nThis could also include upgrading surveillance systems to locate and identify vehicles, boats and aircrafts correctly.\nWithin this priority, the Community contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for projects addressing the following specific priorities:\n(1) investments in establishing or upgrading a single national coordination centre, which coordinates 24/7 the activities of all national authorities carrying out external border control tasks (detection, identification, and intervention) and which is able to exchange information with the national coordination centres in other Member States;\n(2) investments in establishing or upgrading a single national surveillance system, which covers all or selected parts of the external border and enables the dissemination of information 24/7 between all authorities involved in external border control;\n(3) purchase and/or upgrading of equipment for detection, identification and intervention at the borders (e.g. vehicles, vessels, aircraft, helicopters, sensors, cameras, etc.), provided the need for this equipment has been clearly identified at European level.\nPRIORITY 3:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0support for the issuing of visas and the tackling of illegal immigration, including the detection of false or falsified documents by enhancing the activities organised by the consular and other services of the Member States in third countries.\nWithin this priority, the Community contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for projects addressing the following specific priorities:\n(1) promotion of systematic and regular cooperation between the consular services of Member States and between the consular and other services of different Member States in the visa field;\n(2) initiatives to develop and establish limited representation, co-location or common visa application centres for, initially, reception and, at a later stage, processing of visa applications.\nPRIORITY 4:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0support for the establishment of IT systems required for implementation of the Community legal instruments in the field of external borders and visas.\nWithin this priority, the Community contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for projects addressing the following specific priorities:\n(1) investments linked to the Schengen Information System (SIS);\n(2) investments linked to the Visa Information System (VIS).\nPRIORITY 5:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0support for effective and efficient application of relevant Community legal instruments in the

contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for projects addressing the following specific priorities:\n(1) implementation at national level of the common core curriculum for border guards\u2019 training;\n(2) enhancing the quality of the national input into the common integrated risk analysis model.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Within the context of this Decision external borders management only refers to control on persons.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0For the most recent documents on European policy in this field see in particular: \u2018Global approach to migration: Priority actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean\u2019 adopted by the European Council on 15-16 December 2005 (Bull. 12-2005, points I.6. and I.15-I.20.) and the Communication on reinforcing the management of the European Union\u2019s
