The NAFO rebuilding plan pursues the same objectives as the recovery plans provided for in Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(3).\n(5) In order to rebuild the stock, the NAFO rebuilding plan provides for a reduction of the TAC level until 2007 as well as control measures to ensure the effectiveness of that plan.\n(6) The NAFO rebuilding plan was implemented on a provisional basis in Regulations (EC) No 2287/2003\u00a0(4) and (EC) No 27/2005\u00a0(5) respectively fixing for 2004 and 2005 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in the Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required, pending the adoption of a Council Regulation implementing multi-annual measures to rebuild the Greenland halibut stock.\n(7) It is therefore necessary to implement the NAFO rebuilding plan on a permanent basis by means of a recovery plan as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002. To that end a procedure should be determined for the transmission of the list of vessels to which a special fishing permit has been issued in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1627/94 of 27 June 1994 laying down general provisions concerning special fishing permits\u00a0(6).\n(8) To comply with the control measures of the NAFO rebuilding plan, reporting obligations should be imposed on masters of Community vessels, as well as an obligation for Member States to allocate its quota among its authorised vessels.\n(9) Additional control measures are required to ensure an effective implementation at Community level and to ensure coherence with recovery plans adopted by the Council in other areas. Such measures should include an obligation for prior notification of entry into port designated by Member States and to limit margins of tolerance,", "main_body": ["Subject-matter\nThis Regulation lays down the general rules and conditions for the application by the Community of a recovery plan for the Greenland halibut stock in NAFO Sub-area 2 and Divisions 3KLMNO.\nThe objective of that recovery plan shall be to attain a level of exploitable biomass of five years and older of 140\u00a0000 tonnes on average allowing a stable yield over the long term in the Greenland halibut fishery.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018NAFO Sub-area 2\u2019 means the geographic area defined in Annex III 3(a) of the NAFO Convention;\n2. \u2018Divisions 3KLMNO\u2019 means the geographic area defined in Annex III 4(b) of the NAFO Convention.", "Total Allowable Catches (TACs)\nThe TACs for the Greenland halibut stock in NAFO Sub-area 2 and Divisions 3KLMNO shall be the following:\n\u2014 18\u00a0500 tonnes in 2006,\n\u2014 16\u00a0000 tonnes in 2007.\nHowever, where in the framework of NAFO new TAC levels are agreed, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adjust the TACs provided for in the first subparagraph accordingly.", "Prohibition concerning Greenland halibut\nIt shall be prohibited for Community fishing vessels to fish Greenland halibut in NAFO Sub-area 2 and Divisions 3KLMNO and to retain on board, trans-ship or land Greenland halibut fished in that zone if they do not carry a special fishing permit issued by the flag Member State.", "Special fishing permits for Greenland halibut stock\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member State shall ensure that vessels to which a special fishing permit referred to in Article 4 has been issued are included in a list containing their name and Community fleet register number (CFR) as defined in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 26/2004 of 30 December 2003 on the Community fishing fleet register\u00a0(7).
