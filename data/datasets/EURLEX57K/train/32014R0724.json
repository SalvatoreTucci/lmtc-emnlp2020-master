For the exchange of official statistics, SDMX provides statistical and technical standards, including the SDMX Markup Language, using XML syntax (\u2018SDMX-ML format\u2019). A new data format and data structure definition designed in accordance with this standard should therefore be introduced. In order to facilitate the transition to the new format, the Commission should, for the first two years after the entry into force of the Regulation, provide Member States with templates, which can be used as inputs to SDMX conversion tools.\n(4) The Commission should make available detailed documentation in relation to the SDMX data structure definitions and supply guidelines on their implementation.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee,", "main_body": ["Standard for the transmission of data\nMember States shall provide data required by the Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 using SDMX data structure definitions.", "Technical specifications of data format\nMember States shall provide data and metadata in SDMX-ML format.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 September 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0174, 26.6.2013, p.\u00a01."}
