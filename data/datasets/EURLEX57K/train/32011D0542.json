The debt to GDP ratio would peak in 2013 and be placed on a declining path thereafter, assuming further progress in the reduction of the deficit. Debt dynamics are affected by several below-the-line operations, including capital injection into banks in 2011 with net debt-increasing effect of around 6 percentage points of GDP, an assumption to maintain high cash reserves, and differences between accrued and cash interest payments.\n(4) The Irish authorities have indicated that there are very realistic prospects, based on the results of the Liability Management Exercises (LME) conducted thus far, to secure a further EUR 0,51\u00a0billion private sector-contribution to the recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland by 31 December 2011. In light of the already large public cost of the bank recapitalisation, and given the conservative approach used to determine Bank of Ireland\u2019s recapitalisation need, it is now deemed unnecessary and indeed inappropriate for Ireland to inject that amount of EUR 0,51\u00a0billion in advance of the completion of further private sector-contributions in order to meet the programme deadline, as doing so would result in higher than needed fiscal cost and an unnecessarily high capital adequacy ratio for Bank of Ireland once the proceeds from the further private sector-contribution become available. The deadline for the completion of this part of the recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland has been reset to end 2011.\n(5) In light of these developments, Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU should be amended,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1(3) is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 3(7) is amended as follows:\n(a) point (g) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(g) the recapitalisation of the domestic banks by end July 2011 (subject to appropriate adjustment for expected asset sales and liability management exercises in the cases of Irish Life & Permanent and Bank of Ireland) in line with the findings of the 2011 Prudential Liquidity Assessment Review (PLAR) and Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR), as announced by the Central Bank of Ireland on 31 March 2011. To allow further burden sharing, the final EUR 0,51\u00a0billion step in recapitalising Bank of Ireland will be completed by end 2011 and any further recapitalisation of Irish Life & Permanent will be completed following the disposal of the insurance arm.\u2019;\n(b) the following points are added:\n\u2018(q) the submission to the D\u00e1il, by end October, of a Pre-Budget Outlook setting out a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan for 2012-15 outlining the overall composition of revenue and expenditure adjustments for each year, consistent with the targets set out in the Council Recommendation of 7 December 2010;\n(r) the announcement, by 2012 Budget day (early December 2011), of binding medium-term expenditure cash ceilings and set out revenue and expenditure measures to deliver the needed adjustment over 2012-15;\n(s) the issuance by the Central Bank of Ireland, by end December 2011, of guidance to banks for the recognition of accounting losses incurred in their loan book;\n(t) the publication by the Central Bank of Ireland, by end December 2011, of new guidelines for the valuation of collateral for bank loans;\n(u) the preparation and discussion, by end December 2011, of a draft programme of asset disposals, including the identification of the potential assets to be disposed, any necessary regulatory changes, and a timetable for implementation.\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland.", "This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 September 2011.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
