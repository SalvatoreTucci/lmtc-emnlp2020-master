Subject to the other provisions of this Article, the release for free circulation in the  Community of the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the presentation of import  authorization issued by the Member States' authorities at the importer's request, on presentation  by the said importer of an export document conforming to the model in Annex III, issued by the  Taiwan Textile Federation.\n4.

The release after 1 January 1993 for free circulation in the Community of the products covered  by this Regulation shall be subject to the important arrangements which were in force before that  date, provided that the products were loaded on board in Taiwan before 1 January 1993.\n6. Should it appear that additional supplies of a product listed in Annex II are required in the  Community, importation of amounts greater than those mentioned in Annex II may be authorized in  accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 9.\n7. The definition of quantitative limits laid down in Annex II and of the categories of products to  which they apply shall be adapted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 9, where  this proves necessary to ensure that any subsequent amendment to the combined nomenclature or a  decision amending the classification of such products does not result in a reduction of such  quantitative limits.", "1.

Where it emerges that the conditions for the adoption of quantitative limits are met in one or  more regions of the Community, the Commission, after having examined alternative solutions, may  exceptionally authorize the application of surveillance or of quantitative measures limited to the  regions concerned if it considers that such measures are more appropriate than measures applied  throughout the Community.\nThese measures must be temporary and must disrupt the operation of the internal market as little as  possible.\n4. The limits referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be set by the Commission in accordance with  the procedure referred to in Article 9.\n5. The provisions for the administration of the quantitative quotas described in Article 2, and in  particular Article 2, Article 4 and Article 6 to 8 of this Regulation, shall apply to quantitative  limits established under this Article, save for any different provisions adopted in accordance with  the procedure referred to in Article 9.", "1.

Where the Commission finds that products originating in Taiwan which are subject to  quantitative quotas established under this Regulation have been transhipped, rerouted or otherwise  imported into the Community in circumvention of this Regulation and where there is clear proof of  such circumvention, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 9,  deduct from the quantitative quotas established under this Regulation an amount equivalent to the  amount of the products concerned originating in Taiwan.", "Specific quotas for products of economic outward processing operations fulfilling the  conditions set out in Regulation (EEC) No 636/82 (1) may be established, in accordance with the  procedure described in Article 9, in respect of the products listed in Annex II or subject to  quantitative limits under Article 3.", "Products referred to in Article 1 which are brought into the customs territory of the  Community under inward processing arrangements or under other temporary admission arrangements and  re-exported from that territory in the unaltered state or after processing shall not be charged  against the quotas as established in articles 2 and 3.", "1.
