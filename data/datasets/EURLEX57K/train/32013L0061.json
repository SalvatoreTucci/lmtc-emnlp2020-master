Union tax provisions will apply to Mayotte after this amendment of status.\n(2) As regards value added tax (VAT) and excise duties, Mayotte is in a situation similar to that of the other French outermost regions (Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, R\u00e9union and Saint-Martin), which fall outside the territorial scope of Council Directive 2006/112/EC\u00a0(4) and Council Directive 2008/118/EC\u00a0(5), and should therefore be excluded from the territorial scope of those Directives as from the date its status is amended under the TFEU. The relevant provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC and Directive 2008/118/EC should consequently be adapted and their application to the French overseas territories at the same time be clarified.\n(3) In order to make it clear that Mayotte and the other French outermost regions are excluded from the scope of Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC regardless of any change in their status under French law, reference should be made in those Directives to Article 349 and Article 355(1) TFEU in respect of those regions.\n(4) Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Point (c) of Article 6(1) of Directive 2006/112/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) the French territories referred to in Article 349 and Article 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;\u2019.", "Article 5 of Directive 2008/118/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) Point (b) of paragraph (2) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) the French territories referred to in Article 349 and Article 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;\u2019.\n(2) Paragraph (5) is replaced by the following:", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive with effect from 1 January 2014.
