The European Union has been seeking an increasingly closer relationship with Ukraine in view of the latter's political association and economic integration with the Union. In that respect, between\u00a02007 and\u00a02011 the Union and Ukraine negotiated the Association Agreement between the European Union and its Member\u00a0States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part\u00a0(2) (the Association Agreement), including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), which was signed by both parties on\u00a027\u00a0June\u00a02014. Under the provisions of the DCFTA, the Union and Ukraine are to establish a free trade area over a transitional period of a maximum of\u00a010 years, starting from the entry into force of the Association Agreement, in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\u00a01994.\n(2) In light of the unprecedented security, political and economic challenges faced by Ukraine, and in order to support its economy, it was decided to anticipate the implementation of the Schedule of concessions set out in Annex I-A to the Association Agreement by means of the autonomous trade preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No\u00a0374/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council\u00a0(3). In view of the challenges Ukraine still faces, the application of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0374/2014 should be extended until\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02015. For the purpose of predictability, the customs duties and access to tariff quotas for the extended period should remain the same as for\u00a02014.\n(3) Article\u00a02 of the Association Agreement provides that respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and respect for the principle of the rule of law constitute essential elements of that Agreement. Furthermore, it provides that the promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence, as well as countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, related materials and their means of delivery also constitute essential elements of that Agreement. The autonomous preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No\u00a0374/2014 should also be subject to the respect for those same principles by Ukraine. In order to align Regulation (EU) No\u00a0374/2014 with Union practice and other EU trade policy instruments, it is appropriate to introduce the possibility to temporarily suspend the preferences in case of failure to respect the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by Ukraine.\n(4) In view of the urgency of the matter, it is important to apply an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article\u00a04 of Protocol No\u00a01 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No\u00a0374/2014 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article\u00a01 is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Article\u00a02, the following point is added:\n\u2018(e) respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law provided for in Article\u00a02 of the Association Agreement\u00a0(4).\n(3) in Article\u00a07, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(4) Annexes II and III are replaced by the text set out respectively in Annexes I and II to this\u00a0Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from\u00a02\u00a0November\u00a02014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member\u00a0States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 October 2014.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
