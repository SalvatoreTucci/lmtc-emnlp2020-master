It is therefore necessary to redefine the obligations relating to the fishing effort declarations for the western waters.\n(3) The existing obligations for the fishing effort declarations for the Baltic Sea, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2092/98, should remain in force.\n(4) By reason of the number and the importance of the amendments to be made and with regard to coherence between the new obligations for the western waters and the existing obligations for the Baltic Sea, Regulation (EC) No 2092/98 should be repealed.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in
