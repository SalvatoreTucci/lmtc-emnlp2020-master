In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of \u2018cereal products\u2019, namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for \u2018other cereals\u2019, these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.\n(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.\n(5) The current situation on the cereals market and, in particular, the supply prospects mean that the export refunds should be abolished.\n(6) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The export refunds on the compound feedingstuffs covered by Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 April 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 March 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 51.\nANNEX\nto the Commission Regulation of 31 March 2005 fixing the export refunds on cereal-based compound feedingstuffs\nProduct codes benefiting from export refund:\n2309\u00a010\u00a011\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a010\u00a013\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a010\u00a031\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a010\u00a0339000,\n2309\u00a010\u00a051\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a010\u00a053\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a090\u00a031\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a090\u00a033\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a090\u00a041\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a090\u00a043\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a090\u00a051\u00a09000,\n2309\u00a090\u00a053\u00a09000,\nCereal products Destination Unit of measurement Amount of refunds\nMaize and maize products: C10 EUR/t 0,00\nCereal products excluding maize and maize products C10 EUR/t 0,00\nNB: The product codes and the \u2018A\u2019 series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\nC10 : All destinations."}
