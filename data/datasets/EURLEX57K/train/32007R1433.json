In the interests of simplifying legislation and with a view to harmonising measures to manage agricultural markets under the single common organisation of the market, a standing invitation to tender for the sale of alcohol should be opened by the Commission as well as partial invitations to tender opened by the Member States.\n(3) To ensure that the information on the partial invitations to tender in the Member States is accessible by all approved undertakings in the Community, that information should be published in electronic form.\n(4) To prevent all the alcohol in stock from being sold all at once or for the benefit of just one undertaking, the maximum quantity that may be put up for sale under each partial invitation to tender should be limited.\n(5) To ensure that alcohol is disposed of regularly and optimally, and taking account of the slack period during the summer and at Christmas, a deadline for the partial invitations to tender should be laid down once a month, except in July and December.\n(6) The various stages and characteristics of the partial invitations to tender should be specified.\n(7) Recent experience has shown that plans of the plants where the alcohol is processed into absolute alcohol are not essential for approval of undertakings that may participate in the sale of alcohol for use in the form of bioethanol in the Community. That requirement should therefore be removed from the list of documents to be provided for approval.\n(8) To protect the interests of tendering undertakings during the partial invitations to tender, provision should be laid down to limit the physical movement of alcohol put up for sale between the time when the notice for the partial invitation to tender is published and its removal by the undertaking awarded the contract.\n(9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000\u00a0(2) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
