For this reason, the level of the annual fee and the fees related to technical examinations were decreased during a transitional period.\n(3) As regards the annual fee, the transitional period during which the level of this fee was decreased was already prolonged until the end of 2007. As regards the fees for technical examinations, the transitional period during which the level of these fees was decreased was prolonged until the end of 2006.\n(4) It is however foreseen that despite the measures taken in order to decrease the financial reserve of the Office, the level of the reserve will not decrease to an appropriate level in the short term. The level of the annual fee should therefore be further decreased. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Community Plant Variety Rights,", "main_body": ["Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The office shall charge a holder of a Community plant variety right (hereinafter referred to as the holder) a fee for each year of the duration of a Community plant variety right (hereinafter referred to as annual fee) of EUR\u00a0300 for the years 2003 to 2005 and of EUR\u00a0200 for the year 2006 and the following years.
