Consequently that zone should be extended, taking into account the data available on the ecology of the vector and the current meteorological situation.\n(4) Following the notification of outbreaks of bluetongue in mid-August and early September 2006 by Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands, the Commission has amended several times Decision 2005/393/EC as regards the demarcation of the restricted zone concerned.\n(5) On 6 November 2006 Germany informed the Commission of new outbreaks of bluetongue in North-Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Lower Saxony. In view of those findings, it is appropriate to amend the demarcation of the restricted zone in Germany and France.\n(6) On 6 November 2006 Italy also informed the Commission that serotype 1 virus has been detected as circulating for the first time in Cagliari province in the Sardegna region already located in the restricted zone C. Consequently, in view of those new findings, it is appropriate to insert a new restricted zone including the affected area.\n(7) Decision 2005/393/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2005/393/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 74.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 130, 24.5.2005, p. 22.
