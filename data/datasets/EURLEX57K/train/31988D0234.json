Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Intrascope (Optical Probe)'.\n2. The appartus shall be equipped with a hexagonal-shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 millimetres (and of 19 millimetres at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a viewing window and a light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres, and having an operating distance of between 3 and 45 millimetres.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n1.2 // y 1=   // 64,8 - 0,69x1 + 0,095x2 - 0,42x3   // or  //   // y 1=   // 65,5 - 1,15x1 + 0,076x2,   // where:   //  // y 1=   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1=   // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (measurement known as 'P2'),  //   // or   //   // the average thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 4 and 7,5 centimetres respectively off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (measurement known as'1 / 2 (P1 + P3)'),   // x2 =  // the weight of the cold carcase in kilograms,   // x3 =  // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs (measurement known as 'rib-fat').\nThe two formulae shall be valid for carcases weighing between 30 and 120 kilograms.\nPART 2\nFat-O-Meater (FOM)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Fat-O-Meater (FOM)'\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 6 millimetres diameter containing a photodiode of the Siemens SFH 950/960 type and having an operating distance of between 3 and 103 millimetres. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n1.2 // y 1=   // 59,0 - 0,58x1 - 0,32x3 + 0,18x4   // where  //   // y 1=   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1 =   // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (measurement known as 'P2'),  //   // or   //   // the average thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 4 and 7,5 centimetres respectively off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (measurement known as '1 / 2 (P1 + P3)',   // x3 =  // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs (measurement known as 'rib-fat'),   // x4 =   // the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x3 (measurement known as 'rib-muscle').\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 30 and 120 kilograms. PART 3\nHennessy Grading Probe (HGP II)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP II)'.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 millimetres at the blade of the top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO and photodetector of the type 58 MR) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP II itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n1.2 // y 1=   // 62,5 - 0,62x1 - 0,46x3 + 0,16x4   // where  //   // y 1=   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1 =   // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (measurement known as 'P2'),  //   // or   //   // the average thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 4 and 7,5 centimetres respectively off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (measurement known as'1 / 2 (P1 + P3)',   // x3 =  // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs (measurement known as 'rib-fat'),   // x4 =   // the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x3 (measurement known as 'rib-muscle').\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 30 and 120 kilograms.\nANNEX II\nScale of reductions applicable to the weight of hot pig carcases in the United Kingdom\n(in kilograms)\n1.2,5 //  //  // Carcase weight range (hot)  // Deduction to be applied according to the interval between the sticking of the pig and the weighing of the carcase  //  //  // 1.2.3.4.5 //  // 0 to 45 minutes   // 46 to 180 minutes   // 181 to 330 minutes   // > 330 minutes   //    //  //   //   //   // up to 56 kg   // 1,0   // 0,5   // 0,5  // 0   // 56,5 to 74,5 kg   // 1,5   // 1,0   // 0,5   // 0  // 75 kg and over   // 2,0   // 1,5   // 0,5   // 0   //  //   //   //   //"}
