The application was lodged by Huvis Sichuan (\u2018the applicant\u2019), an exporting producer in the People\u2019s Republic of China (the country concerned).\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRODUCT\n(2) The product under review is synthetic staple fibres of polyesters, not carded, combed or otherwise processed for spinning originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China (the product concerned), currently classifiable within CN code 5503\u00a020\u00a000. This CN code is given only for information.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXISTING MEASURES\n(3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2005\u00a0(2) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 49,7\u00a0% with the exception of companies specially mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW\n(4) The applicant alleges that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively claims individual treatment in conformity with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the above mentioned anti-dumping measures.\n(5) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given and opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.\n(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a \u2018new exporter\u2019 review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively whether the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation and, if so, the applicant's individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.\n(8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 428/2005.\n(a) Questionnaires\n(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(c) Selection of the market economy country\n(d) Market economy status\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS\n(9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force shall be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports shall be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant\u2019s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(10) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in Article 4(1) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission,\n\u2014 interested parties to the investigation can comment on the appropriateness of the United States of America which, in the event that the applicant will not be granted market economy status, is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\n\u2014 the applicant can submit a duly substantiated claim for market economy status.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION\n(11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated,", "main_body": ["A review of Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 in order to determine if and to what extent the imports of synthetic staple fibres of polyesters, not carded, combed or otherwise processed for spinning falling within CN code 5503\u00a020\u00a000 originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, produced by Huvis Sichuan (TARIC additional code A736) and sold for export to the Community should be subject to the anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2005.", "The anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 is hereby repealed with regard to the imports identified in Article 1.", "The customs authorities of the Member States are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports identified in Article 1.
