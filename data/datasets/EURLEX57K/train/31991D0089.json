For the Commission\nRay MAC SHARRY\nMember of the Commission   (1) OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 19.\nANNEX\nProtocol for study on parameters to inactivate the BSE/scrapie agent in the commercial rendering process\n1. The work related to this study will be carried out in the United Kingdom, as follows:\n1. Pilot-plant rendering - Prosper de Mulder, Doncaster;\n2. Bio-assay in mice - Institute for Animal Health, Compton.\nThe provision of suitable material will be supervised by the Veterinary Service of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the United Kingdom, who will act as coordinators for this project.\n2. Objectives and results\nThe objectives are to study rendering processes. The expected results and achievements will be a definition of parameters for rendering which will produce a safe product from the point of view of scrapie and BSE.\n3. Summary of the literature\nThe causal agents of scrapie and BSE are highly resistant to heat, chemicals and ionizing radiation.\nIt appears that, prior to 1980/81, the rendering processes used in the United Kingdom did control the infective agent, but, some time in the early 1980s, changes in the rendering processes allowed sufficient agent to survive and cause disease. The newer  systems differ from the old, and from those in use in other Member States, in a number of respects and neither the literature nor investigations carried out to date reveal the precise parameters necessary to inactivate the agent.\n4. The work to be carried out\nThis research will use brains from:\n1. cattle infected with BSE;\n2. sheep or goats affected with scrapie,\n(a) from United Kingdom sources;\n(b) from other Member States.\nThe objective of 2 (a) and (b) is to take account of possible strain differences. The full protocol will be repeated with each type and source of material.\nIn each case the infective brains will be processed in pilot-scale rendering equipment to simulate the most representative systems in use in the United Kingdom and other Member States. The resulting material will be assessed by bio-assay. It will be  injected into susceptible strains of mice which will be observed and examined for signs of disease. The full protocol has been submitted to and agreed by the Scientific Veterinary Committee.\nIt is anticipated that the results will be obtained in two to three years from commencement of the study."}
