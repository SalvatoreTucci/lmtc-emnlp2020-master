The Annex to that Decision demarcates and lists certain areas differentiated by the level of risk based on the epidemiological situation. That list includes certain areas of Italy, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.\n(2) Since 26 June 2014, the presence of African swine fever has been identified in feral pigs and domestic pigs in Latvia. The likely source of the introduction of African swine fever virus is from neighbouring third countries that have reported the occurrence of that disease. Several outbreaks in domestic pigs were reported near the Latvian border with third countries and cases in feral pigs were found in the same area, up to 30 kilometres from that border. In addition, several outbreaks in domestic pigs and few cases in feral pigs were reported in Latvia near the Estonian border. New findings were also reported by Lithuania, notably one outbreak in a pig holding in the Eastern part of the country.\n(3) The evolution of the current epidemiological situation should be considered in the assessment of the risk represented by the animal health situation in Lithuania, Latvia and in neighbouring third countries. In order to focus animal health control measures and to prevent the spread of that disease as well as to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade by third countries, the Union list of areas subject to the animal health control measures provided for in Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU should be amended and take into account the current animal health situation as regards that disease in Lithuania and Latvia.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to amend the annex to Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU to include the relevant areas of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\n(5) Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The annex to Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU is amended in accordance with the annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 July 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0395, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a018, 23.1.2003, p.\u00a011.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU of 27 March 2014 concerning animal health control measures relating to African swine fever in certain Member States (OJ L\u00a095, 29.3.2014, p.\u00a047).\nANNEX\nThe annex to Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Part I is amended as follows:\n(a) the entry for Latvia is replaced by the following:\nthe whole of the novads of Mazsalaca\nthe whole of the novads of Aloja\nthe whole of the novads of Koc\u0113ni and the pils\u0113ta of Valmiera\nthe whole of the novads of Prieku\u013ci\nin the novads of Rauna the pagasts of Rauna\nthe whole of the novads of Smiltene\nthe whole of the novads of Ape\nin the novads of Ludza the pagasti of Cirma, Pure\u0146i, \u0145uk\u0161i, Isnauda, Pilda, Nirza and Bri\u0123i\nthe whole of the novads of Cibla\nin the novads of R\u0113zekne the pagasti of Sto\u013cerova, Gri\u0161k\u0101ni, \u010cornaja, L\u016bznava, Malta, Feima\u0146i, Silmala, Ozolaine, Ozolmui\u017ea and Sakstagala\nin the novads of Vi\u013c\u0101ni the pagasti of Sokolki and Vi\u013c\u0101ni\nin the novads of Riebi\u0146i the pagasti of Riebi\u0146i, Ru\u0161ona, Silaj\u0101\u0146i, Gal\u0113ni and Stabulnieki\nthe whole of the novads of Prei\u013ci\nin the novads of L\u012bv\u0101ni the pagasts of Sutri\nthe whole of the novads of V\u0101rkava\nin the novads of Daugavpils the pagasti of Dubna, Vi\u0161\u0137i, Ambe\u013ci, Bi\u0137ernieku, Naujene, Saliena, Vecsaliena, Skrudaliena, Demene, Laucesa, Tabore, Ma\u013cinova, Kalupe and Vabole.\u2019\n(b) the following entry for Estonia is added:\nin the maakond of Viljandi the vald of Karksi and Abja (including the municipality of Moisakula)\nin the maakond of Valga the vald of P\u00f5drala, Helme, Puka, Hummuli, \u00d5ru, Palupera, Otep\u00e4\u00e4, T\u00f5lliste, Karula, Taheva and Sangaste and the linn of Valga and T\u00f5rva\nin the maakond of V\u00f5ru the vald of Urvaste, Antsla, M\u00f5niste and Varstu.\u2019\n(c) the entry for Lithuania is replaced by the following:\nin the apskritis of Marijampol\u0117 the district municipalities of Kalvarija, Marijampol\u0117, Kazl\u0173 R\u016bda\nin the apskritis of Kaunas the district municipalities of Prienai and Bir\u0161tonas\nin the apskritis of Vilnius the district municipalities of Trakai, Elektr\u0117nai, Vilnius city municipality, Vilnius and \u0160ven\u010dionys\nin the apskritis of Utena the district municipalities of Mol\u0117tai, Utena, Zarasai and Visaginas.\u2019\n(2) In Part II, the entry for Latvia is replaced by the following:\nthe whole of the novads of R\u016bjiena\nin the novads of Nauk\u0161\u0113ni the pagasts of \u0136o\u0146i\nin the novads of Burtnieki the pagasti of Vecate, Mat\u012b\u0161i, Burtnieki, and Valmiera\nthe whole of the novads of Bever\u012bna\nin the novads of Valka the pagasti of Vijciems and Zv\u0101rtava.\u2019\n(3) Part III is replaced by the following:\nall areas of Sardinia.\nthe whole of the novads of Zilupe\nin the novads of Ludza the pagasti of Rund\u0113ni and Istra\nin the novads of R\u0113zekne the pagasti of Pu\u0161a, M\u0101ko\u0146kalns and Kaunata\nthe whole of the novads of Dagda\nthe whole of the novads of Aglona\nthe whole of the novads of Kr\u0101slava\nin the novads of Valka the pagasti of K\u0101r\u0137i, \u0112r\u0123eme and Valka\nthe whole of the novads of Stren\u010di\nin the novads of Burtnieki the pagasti of \u0112vele and Renc\u0113ni\nin the novads of Nauk\u0161\u0113ni the pagasts of Nauk\u0161\u0113ni.\nin the apskritis of Utena the district municipality of Ignalina.\u2019"}
