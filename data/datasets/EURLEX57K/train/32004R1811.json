Those habitats host important and highly diverse biological communities and are considered to require priority protection. In particular, they are defined as habitats of Community interest in Council Directive 92/43/EC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora\u00a0(2). Furthermore, deep-water coral reefs have recently been included in a list of endangered habitats in the framework of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention).\n(2) According to scientific evidence, recovery from damage to these habitats produced by trawl gear towed through the bottom is either impossible or very difficult and slow. The waters around the Azores, the Canary Islands and Madeira contains several known or potential deep-water habitats that have until recently been preserved from trawling. It is therefore appropriate to prohibit the use of bottom trawls and similar gear in waters around the Azores, the Canary Islands and Madeira where these habitats are still in a favourable conservation status.\n(3) New scientific information indicates that the catches of cod taken in fisheries carried out under the conditions specified in point 17 of Annex IV to Council Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 of 19 December 2003 fixing for 2004 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required\u00a0(3) are likely to be low, and consequently these fisheries pose little additional risk to cod recovery. An increase in the number of days fishing for haddock is therefore justified.\n(4) In order to ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important that the fisheries be available as soon as possible. Therefore, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period mentioned in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
