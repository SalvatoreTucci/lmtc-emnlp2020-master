In this matter the administration should not act on mere presumptions, and the parties concerned should be allowed to adduce evidence to the contrary where they dispute the level of the open market value established by the administration.\n(4) The measure is strictly targeted so that it can only be invoked when a series of conditions have been met and an absolute tax loss identified; and is therefore proportionate to the aim pursued.\n(5) Similar derogations have been granted to other Member States to counter tax avoidance and have been found to be effective.\n(6) This derogation will safeguard the amount of VAT due at the final consumption stage and has no negative impact on the Communities\u2019 own resources from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 11(A)(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Republic of Cyprus is hereby authorised to use the open market value as the taxable amount of a supply in the circumstances described in Article 2.", "The open market value may be applied only when all the following conditions are met:\n1.
