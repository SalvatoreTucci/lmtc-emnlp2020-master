in the meantime, the cooperation agreements referred to in Regulations (EEC) No 1519/76, (EEC) No 1520/76, (EEC) No 1526/76 and (EEC) No 1251/77 apply;\n(5) under the Agreement on Agriculture concluded in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations the Community agreed to fix the rate of variable levies and to replace them by customs duties from 1 July 1995; this could make the special arrangements based on variable levies inoperable, and therefore, pending the conclusion of new agreements with Algeria, Morocco and Egypt, temporary derogations, which leave the essence of each of those arrangements unaffected, have had to be introduced from Regulations (EEC) No 1519/76, (EEC) No 1520/76, (EEC) No 1526/76 and (EEC) No 1251/77; rules on the temporary adjustment of those Regulations are laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1710/95(5) and (EC) No 1711/95(6) until 30 June 1999 on the basis of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 3290/94(7);\n(6) the advantages granted under the Agreements concerning the import of bran, sharps and other residues of the sifting, milling or other working of certain cereals have thus been replaced in terms of customs duties by, for Algeria and Morocco, a flat-rate reduction of EUR 7,25 per tonne in the common customs tariff duties in replacement of the fixed component concession plus a 60 % reduction of that reduced duty in replacement of the variable component concession and, for Egypt, by a 60 % reduction of the customs duty;\n(7) pending the termination of the current negotiations or the conclusion of the agreements, measures are required to ensure the continuity of trade with the Community by extending the transitional arrangements in force;\n(8) if new agreements are concluded with the third countries in question this Regulation will have to be adjusted;
