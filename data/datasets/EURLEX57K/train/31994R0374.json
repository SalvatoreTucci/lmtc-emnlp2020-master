whereas the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related  matters between the Community and Romania (7), signed in Brussels on 1 February 1993, entered into force on 1 May 1993; whereas the said Agreements provide for a reduction in the import levy for some products of the poultrymeat and egg sectors within  certain quantity limits; whereas it is necessary therefore to lay down certain detailed rules of application in this respect;\nWhereas the measures to be adopted for applying the Interim Agreements laid down in this Regulation should take effect on 1 January 1994; whereas they should however, be limited initially to the first two quarters of 1994 in order to take account of the  Additional Protocols to the Interim Agreements which have been signed between the Community and the two abovementioned countries and pending clarification of certain other factors relating to the exact timing of the introduction of the Community  concessions;\nWhereas, while bearing in mind the provisions of the Interim Agreements intended to guarantee the origin of the product, provision should be made for the administration of the said arrangements to be guaranteed by import licences for the majority of the  products;

whereas, in addition,  provision should be made for the certificates and licences to be issued after a period of consideration, applying, where necessary, a single percentage reduction;\nWhereas, in order to ensure proper administration of the system, the guarantee for import licences under the said system should be fixed at ECU 90 per 100 kg; whereas, in view of the likelihood of speculation inherent in the system in the egg and  poultrymeat sectors, precise conditions governing access by operators to the said system should be laid down;\nWhereas, for live geese, whole geese or geese cut in pieces, it is possible to replace the system of import licences with a system for monitoring quantities actually imported which is less restrictive for importers;\nWhereas, in the case of those products, equal and continuous access to the quantities subject to a reduced levy should be ensured for all Community importers, and the levy should be applied consistently until the quantities are exhausted; whereas the  necessary measures should be taken to ensure efficient Community administration of those quantities by providing the opportunity to draw from the volume of those quantities on the basis of actual imports;
