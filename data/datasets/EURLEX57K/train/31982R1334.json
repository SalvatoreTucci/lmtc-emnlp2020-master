whereas the exporter and some of the importers in question have availed themselves of this opportunity and made their views known orally and in writing; whereas the Commission has carefully examined the arguments put forward and found no reason to amend the provisionally established weighted average dumping margin;\nWhereas, with regard to the injury, the Commission has received no information since the adoption of Regulation (EEC) No 250/82 which would make it necessary to revise its conclusions formulated in that Regulation;\nWhereas some importers have, however, stated that the Romanian tubes were partly accepted in return for exports to Romania and that the latter are being hampered by the Commission intervention; whereas this does not, however, detract from the fact that the imports in question were made at dumping prices; whereas the Commission found that the dumped tubes were in some cases even sold at a loss; whereas the prices of the Romanian tubes were, in any case, up to 20 % lower than the German producers' market price; whereas in view of the extent of the injury resulting therefrom and the difficult situation facing European tube producers, the Commission has therefore become convinced that the interests of the Community make protective measures necessary;\nWhereas, on being presented with these findings, the Romanian exporter, Metalimportexport Bucharest, offered the Commission an undertaking that it would adhere to certain minimum prices in respect of its exports to the Federal Republic of Germany; whereas the Commission regards this undertaking as sufficient to eliminate the injurious effects of those exports; whereas no objections at all were raised regarding this view in the Advisory Committee set up under Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79; whereas the undertaking may therefore be accepted, the procedure terminated and the provisional duty cancelled;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 10 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79, the termination of the procedure and cancelling of the provisional duty does not preclude the definitive collection of amounts secured in implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 250/82 by way of provisional duties pursuant to Article 12 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79,", "main_body": ["The Commission hereby accepts the undertaking offered by Metalimportexport in connection with the anti-dumping procedure concerning imports of welded iron or steel tubes, not zinc-coated, of circular cross-section, of an external diameter of not more than 168;3 mm:\n- threaded or threadable tubes (gas pipe),\n- other tubes\nfalling within Common Customs Tariff subheading ex 73.18 C (NIMEXE codes 73.18-64 and 82), originating in Romania.", "The anti-dumping procedure regarding imports of certain welded steel tubes originating in Romania shall be terminated.", "Regulation (EEC) No 250/82 of 29 January 1982 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on certain welded iron or steel tubes originating in Romania shall be revoked.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 May 1982.\nFor the Commission\nWilhelm HAFERKAMP\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 339, 31. 12. 1979, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No C 299, 18. 11. 1981, p. 2.\n(3) OJ No L 26, 3. 2. 1982, p. 5."}
