Both of these measures should allow the effective combating of fraud in the sectors concerned.\n(5) The United Kingdom has asked for the extension of Decision 98/23/EC(6) allowing the appropriate authorities, under certain conditions, to direct that the open-market value be taken as the taxable amount for intra-Community acquisitions of goods where there are family, legal or business links between the person acquiring the goods and the supplier. This special measure is an anti-avoidance measure derogating from Article 28e(1) of the Sixth Directive.\n(6) The United Kingdom has also requested an extension of Decision 97/375/EC(7) authorising it to extend the application of an optional cash accounting scheme for enterprises with an annual turnover below a certain ceiling, whereby tax is assessed on the basis of payments made and received. In addition, the United Kingdom has asked to be able to raise the ceiling of GBP 400000 to GBP 600000. Raising the ceiling for the simplified scheme, and thus also for the derogation which forms an integral part of it, will allow a greater number of firms to opt for the scheme.\n(7) The matters of law and of fact which justified the application of the special measures in question have not changed and still pertain.\n(8) The period for the authorisations should therefore be extended until 31 December 2003 and the ceiling of GBP 400000 in Article 1 of Decision 97/375/EC should be raised to GBP 600000.\n(9) The derogations in question have no impact on the European Communities' own resources from valued added tax,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Decision 97/375/EC shall be replaced by the following:\n\"Article 1\nBy way of derogation from the provisions of Article 17(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the United Kingdom is hereby authorised, until 31 December 2003, to provide, within an optional scheme, that enterprises with an annual turnover not higher than GBP 600000 must postpone the right of deduction of tax until it has been paid to the supplier.\"", "In Article 1 of Decisions 97/510/EC, 98/20/EC, 98/23/EC and 98/161/EC the date 31 December 1999 shall be replaced by 31 December 2003.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 29 June 2000.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
