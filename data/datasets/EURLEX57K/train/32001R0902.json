For one particular subsidy scheme, the \"tax credit for the purchase of automation and pollution control equipment\" granted for locally purchased equipment, was found to be countervailable according to the Regulation the subject of challenge. However, the calculations concerning the amount of countervailable subsidy derived from a methodology that was revised in subsequent proceedings concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Taiwan. Reference is made to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1741/2000(3), Council Regulation (EC) No 2603/2000(4), inter alia terminating the antisubsidy proceeding concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Taiwan. In these circumstances, it was decided to re-examine the calculations concerning the amount of subsidy for imports originating in Taiwan, in particular in order to establish whether the application of the revised methodology would materially impact on the findings for that country. This particular subsidy scheme was only found to exist in Taiwan and was not therefore considered as part of the investigation into subsidisation in respect of imports originating in Australia and Indonesia.\n(3) The re-examination for Taiwan showed that the revised methodology led to a de minimis finding of subsidisation, i.e. a countrywide subsidy level of less than 1 %. Therefore, the countervailing measures concerning imports of synthetic fibres of polyester from Taiwan should be repealed with retroactive effect.\n(4) As regards the potential impact of the repeal of measures for Taiwan on the original findings concerning imports of synthetic fibres of polyester from Australia and Indonesia, it was examined whether the finding of de minimis subsidisation for Taiwan adversely affected the conclusions in relation to injury, causation and Community interest. It was concluded that, in particular given the significant increase in the volume of imports and market share, and the high levels of undercutting for imports originating in Australia and Indonesia, the original findings are not undermined insofar as they concern imports originating in those countries,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 978/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
