Detailed rules on the approval and certification of innovative technologies for reducing CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles are set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 427/2014\u00a0(4).\n(2) In order to take account of the CO2 savings achieved through the use of innovative technologies for the calculation of each manufacturer's specific emissions target of CO2 and in order to ensure efficient monitoring of the specific CO2 savings for individual vehicles, vehicles fitted with eco-innovations should be certified as part of the type approval of a vehicle and the savings should, in accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0427/2014, be specified separately in both the type approval documentation and the certificate of conformity in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC.\n(3) Consequently, it is necessary to modify the documents used in the type-approval process, in order to adequately reflect the information related to eco-innovations.\n(4) The amendment of the documents used for type approval aims, on the one hand, at providing the approval authorities with the adequate data for certifying light commercial vehicles fitted with eco-innovations, and, on the other hand, at integrating the CO2 savings of the eco-innovations as part of the representative information of a specific type, variant or version of vehicle.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008\u00a0(5) lays down the administrative provisions for checking the conformity of the vehicles for CO2 emissions and the requirements for the measurement of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of such vehicles.\n(6) Directive 2007/46/EC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Sufficient lead time should be given in order to allow manufacturers and national authorities to adapt their procedures to the new rules.\n(8) Manufacturers should have the possibility to apply, on a voluntary basis, for the certification of the CO2 savings due to the implementation of innovative technologies, before the date of application of the new rules.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee \u2014 Motor Vehicles,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and IX to Directive 2007/46/EC are amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annexes I and XII to Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 are amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "With effect from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, national authorities shall not refuse to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval in respect of vehicle types which comply with this Regulation.\nFrom 1 January 2016, type-approvals of vehicle types fitted with innovative technologies for reducing CO2 emissions, shall be granted in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC and Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 as amended by this Regulation.\nFrom 1 January 2016 at the latest, manufacturers shall deliver certificates of conformity in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC and Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 as amended by this Regulation for all new vehicles.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 January 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0171, 29.6.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0263, 9.10.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (OJ\u00a0L\u00a0145, 31.5.2011, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 427/2014 of 25 April 2014 establishing a procedure for the approval and certification of innovative technologies for reducing CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a0125, 26.4.2014, p.\u00a057).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 of 18 July 2008 implementing and amending Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information (OJ L\u00a0199, 28.7.2008, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX I\nAnnexes I and IX to Directive 2007/46/EC are amended as follows:\n(1) in Annex I, points 3.5.6 and 3.5.6.1 are replaced by the following:\n\u20183.5.6.
