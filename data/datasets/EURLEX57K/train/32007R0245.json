Therefore Malaysia should be included in the list set out in Part C of Annex\u00a0II to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003.\n(5) Since Bulgaria and Romania have been Member States since 1\u00a0January 2007, in the interest of clarity of Community legislation it is necessary to remove references to those countries from Part C of Annex\u00a0II to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003 with effect from the date of accession.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003 Part C of Annex\u00a0II is amended as follows:\n(1) The following entries are deleted:\n(2) The following entry is inserted: \u2018MY \u2014 Malaysia\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "(1) shall apply from 1\u00a0January 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8\u00a0March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0146, 13.6.2003, p.\u00a01.
