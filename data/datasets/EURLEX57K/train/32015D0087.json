The indexation is made in accordance with public quotations of corn in the EU, the main raw material normally used in the production of citric acid.\n(7) Moreover, the exporting producers, in order to reduce the risk of price violations by means of cross-compensation of prices, offered to report all non-EU sales to those customers whose organisation or structure extends beyond the EU, should the exporting producer sell to such customers in the EU.\n(8) The exporting producers will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the EU, meaning that the undertakings can be monitored effectively by the Commission. Furthermore, the sales structure of these companies is such that the Commission considers the risk of circumventing the agreed undertakings to be limited.\n(9) It is noted also that the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters (\u2018CCCMC\u2019) is joining the five companies mentioned in recital 4, and that therefore the CCCMC will play also an active role in the monitoring of the undertakings.\n(10) In view of this, the undertakings offered by the exporting producers and CCCMC are acceptable.\n(11) In order to enable the Commission to monitor effectively the companies' compliance with the undertakings, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertakings is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the anti-dumping duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/82. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when the other conditions provided for by the abovementioned Implementing Regulation are not met, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty shall instead be payable.\n(12) To further ensure the respect of the undertakings, importers have been made aware by the abovementioned Implementing Regulation that the non-fulfilment of the conditions provided for by that Regulation, or the withdrawal by the Commission of the acceptance of the undertakings, may lead to a customs debt being incurred for the relevant transactions.\n(13) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking, or in case of withdrawal of the acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission, the anti-dumping duty imposed in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation shall automatically apply pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation,", "main_body": ["The undertakings offered by the exporting producers mentioned below together with the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of citric acid originating in the People's Republic of China, are hereby accepted.\nCountry Company Taric Additional Code\nPeople's Republic of China COFCO Biochemical (Anhui) Co., Ltd \u2014 No 1 COFCO Avenue, Bengbu City 233010, Anhui Province A874\nManufactured by RZBC Co., Ltd \u2014 No 9 Xinghai West Road, Rizhao City, Shandong Province, PRC and sold by its related sales company RZBC Imp. &\u00a0Exp.
