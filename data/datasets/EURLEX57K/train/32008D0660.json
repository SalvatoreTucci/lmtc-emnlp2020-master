Those inspections also revealed serious shortcomings in the capacity of the Indonesian authorities to carry out reliable checks on fish, in particular to detect the presence of histamine and heavy metals in the relevant species.\n(2) Decision 2006/236/EC provides that Member States are to ensure that each consignment of fishery products imported from Indonesia undergoes the necessary tests to make sure that the products do not exceed certain maximum levels for heavy metals and that, in the case of certain species, a test to detect the presence of histamine must be carried out.\n(3) Decision 2006/236/EC also provides that that Decision is to be reviewed on the basis of the guarantees provided by the competent Indonesian authorities and on the basis of the results of the tests carried out by the Member States.\n(4) Indonesia has now provided the Commission with the appropriate guarantees. In addition, the results of the tests carried out by the Member States on fishery products imported from that third country are favourable as regards heavy metals in aquaculture products and as regards histamine. It is therefore no longer necessary to test each consignment of fishery products of relevant species for histamine and each consignment of aquaculture products for heavy metals.\n(5) In Article 2 of Decision 2006/236/EC, reference is made to Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs\u00a0(4). That Regulation has been repealed and replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs\u00a0(5). It is therefore appropriate to amend that reference.\n(6) Decision 2006/236/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/236/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
