Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000\u00a0(2) lays down detailed rules for the implementation of such distillation. Article 63a(10) thereof lays down the deadline by which wine delivered to a distillery must be distilled.\n(2) In some Member States, the volumes covered by contracts concluded by wine producers for distillation in the 2006/07 wine year have been far greater than normal. This has led to a saturation of distillery capacities and, as a result, it will not be possible to complete distillation by the specified deadline. To remedy this situation, the period authorised for distillation should be extended by one month.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 63a(10) of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000, for the 2006/07 wine year the wine delivered to a distillery must be distilled no later than 31 October of the following wine year.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 October 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
