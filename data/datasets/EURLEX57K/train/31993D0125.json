whereas the average tonnage of the Spanish fleet operating in cabotage is  small compared to the competitive fleets from other Member States, therefore, causing a cost  disadvantage; whereas the operating costs of Spanish vessels in Spanish waters can be adjusted only  over a period of time given the need for further revision of applicable agreements and regulations,  whereas for these reasons the likely appearance of ships registered in other Member States' special  registers may pose a serious threat to the survival of Spanish operators in the cabotage market;\nWhereas Spain adopted on 23 December 1992 a ministerial order adopting unilateral safeguard  measures on the basis of the last subparagraph of Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92  consisting of the suspension of the application of the said Regulation in Spain for a period of  three months;\nWhereas on the 8 January 1993 Spain formally comunicated the adoption of the above measure and, on  the basis of a study prepared by the Spanish authorities on the impact of an immediate  liberalization of cabotage on the carriers directly involved, requested the Commission to grant a  derogation of 12 months from the application of the said regulation for continental cabotage  traffic;\nWhereas a meeting was organized by the Commission on the 20 January 1993 to consult other Member  States on this request in accordance with Article 5 (1) of the abovementional Regulation;\nWhereas the Commission considers that the situation described in the study cannot be considered as  an emergency, since the financial stability or existence of a significant number of Spanish  shipowners was not threatened within such a short period of time and therefore cannot justify the  unilateral measure adopted by Spain;\nWhereas a careful examination of the present situation and of the study presented by Spain gives,  on the other hand, sufficient indication that a serious disturbance of the internal transport  market is likely to occur in Spain if a certain period is not allowed for the effective  implementation of the abovementioned agreements and regulations including the special register;  whereas the market is such that there are a large number of ports with relatively small capacity  and installations but that Spain's geographical position makes it an attractive market for cabotage  on both Atlantic and Mediterranean routes; that a combination of these factors means that there is  likely to be a further increase in the alreday existing serious excess of supply over demand which  will pose a serious threat to the financial stability of the Spanish cabotage fleet; whereas,  however, the new Spanish legislation is likely to begin to improve the competitive position of the  Spanish fleet within the near future;\nWhereas of goods from a port in another Member State or in a third country to a continental port in  Spain where they are transhipped on a vessel of the same company to be carried on the other  mainland ports in Spain or vice versa (feeder services) should, however, not benefit from any such  derogation, in order not to hinder an optimal operation of deep sea services by Community carriers  between Spain and other countries, and should be completely free for other Member States'  shipowners as defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92;\nWhereas in the event that no Spanish vessel is available to carry out mainland cabotage services no  serious disturbance can derive from the possibilty for other Member States' vessel to carry out  such services,", "main_body": ["The unilateral safeguard measure adopted by Spain on 23 December  1992, is hereby abrogated and the competent Spanish authorities shall take the necessary  administrative measures to implement the abrogation.", "An exclusion of the Spanish mainland area during six months from the scope of  Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 is hereby granted to Spain as from the date of notification of the  present Decision.", "The abovementioned exclusion shall not apply to feeder services.", "In the event that no Spanish vessel is available at a given moment to meet the demand  for mainland cabotage transport services, the Spanish authorities will allow other Member States'  vessels to offer such services.", "Two independent experts shall appointed, one by the Commission and one by the Spanish  authorities, in order to prepare a joint study on the possible economic impact on the Spanish  shipping sector of the liberalization of mainland cabotage. On the basis of the result of this  study which shall be presented to the Commission at least 45 working days before the expiry date of  the six months' derogation, the Commission will, on request from Spain, review the situation.", "The present Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 February 1993.\nFor the Commission Abel MATUTES Member of the Commission"}
