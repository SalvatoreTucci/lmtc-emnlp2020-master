EXPLORATORY FISHING VOYAGES\nThe task of exploratory fishing voyages must be  to gather data on fisheries for which these are lacking, either because Community fleets do not  know the zones concerned, because the target species have not been caught in the past or because  the method of fishing is truly novel, at least for the species and sectors concerned. The aim is to  gather data required for assessing the potential profitability for Community fleets of a new  fishery. The exploratory nature of voyages for each planned fishery, distinguished by a zone,  target species or group of target species and a fishing method, may only be retained for a very  limited number of voyages.\nIn geographical terms, priority will be given to international waters, the deep coastal waters  around continental shelves and to regions in which EEZs have not yet been systematically  exploited.\nPriority will be given to fishing methods guaranteeing high selectivity. In the context of  selectivity even where an application is not novel with regard to the sectors and species involved,  it may be admissible on the basis of selectivity if it is considered a decisive step towards  improving fishing methods and in particular towards reducing discards.\nB. REDEPLOYMENT OPERATIONS\nThe Commission considers that this type of operation should mainly be  directed towards fishing zones and species where exploratory fishing voyages have previously been  carried out, it having been assumed that there was substantial economic potential for the Community  fleet and whose principal objective was to gain an in-depth knowledge of the resources present  and/or promote a considerable development in the market for these stocks, so that sustained  long-term exploitation, assessed on the basis of these exploratory fishing voyages, could be built  up.\nIn the light of the above, the fishing zones and species most suitable for these redeployment  operations are those which have been the subject of exploratory fishing voyages during previous  years.\nThe fishing methods and gear to be used in these operations are those authorized by the third  countries with sovereignty or jurisdiction over the waters concerned.\nC. JOINT VENTURE\nThe Commission considers that cooperation operations within the context of joint  ventures should be directed towards third countries whose waters contain species which are of  interest for the Community market.\nThe most suitable species are those of interest to the Community market such as cod, cephalopods,  hake and crustaceans.\nFishing methods and gear to be used in these operations are those authorized by the third  countries having sovereignty or jurisdiction over the waters concerned."}
