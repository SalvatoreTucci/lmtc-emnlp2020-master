The information provided was examined and verified, where necessary, at the premises of the parties concerned. Based on this information, the Commission found that the requests submitted by the parties listed in table 1 below are admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nVIVI\u2019 Bikes SRL Via Brescia 1, I-26010 Pozzaglio ed Uniti Italy A428\nStar Due SRL Via De Gasperi 55, I-31010 Coste di Maser Italy A432\nMotomur SL Ctra Mazarr\u00f3n, Km.2, E-30120 El Palmar, Murcia Spain A436\nStar Ciclo, Montagem Comercializa\u00e7a\u00f5 de Bicicletas Lda Vale do Grou, Aguada de Cima, P-3750-064 \u00c1gueda Portugal A445\nUnited Bicycles NV Oude Bunders 2030, B-3630 Maasmechelen Belgium A467\nSachs Fahrzeug- und Motorentechnik GmbH Nopitschstra\u00dfe 70, D-90441 N\u00fcrnberg Germany A485\nAGECE, Montagem e Com\u00e9rcio de Bicicletas SA Zona Industriale Barr\u00f4, Apartado N. 514, P-3754-909 \u00c1gueda Portugal A466\nPostfach 1020, D-59463 Ense Parsit,\nHauptstra\u00dfe 28, D-59469 Ense Parsit\nOpen Space SRL Via Guido Rossa 18/A, I-35020 Roncaglia de Ponte San Nicolo Italy A486\nIMACycles, Acessori\u00f3rios para Bicicletas e Motociclos Lda ZI Oi\u00e3, Apartado 117, P-3770-059 Oliveira do Bairro Portugal A487\nBicicletas de Castilla y Le\u00f3n SL Barrio Gimeno 5, E-09001 Burgos Spain A500\nGiubilato Cicli SRL Via Gaidon 3, I-36067 S.

In addition their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from the date of receipt of their requests for exemption.\n(6) The parties listed in table 2 below also submitted requests for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.\nName City Country TARIC additional code\nPrincipia A/S Fr.

In the light of this, the suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty referred to in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation must be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty must be collected as from the date of receipt of the requests submitted by these parties.\n(8) Following the adoption of this Decision, an updated list of parties exempted pursuant to Article 7 of the exemption Regulation and of parties whose requests pursuant to Article 3 of that Regulation are under examination should be published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Article 16(2) of that Regulation,", "main_body": ["The parties listed below in table 1 are hereby exempted from the extension to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People\u2019s Republic of China by Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on bicycles originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93, and as maintained by Regulation (EC) No 1524/2000.\nThe exemptions shall take effect in relation to each party as from the relevant date shown in the column headed \u2018Date of effect\u2019.\nTABLE 1\nList of parties to be exempted\nName Address Country Exemption pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 88/97 Date of effect TARIC additional code\nVIVI\u2019 Bikes SRL Via Brescia 1, I-26010 Pozzaglio ed Uniti Italy Article 7 22.1.2003 A428\nStar Due SRL Via De Gasperi 55, I-31010 Coste di Maser Italy Article 7 31.1.2003 A432\nMotomur SL Ctra Mazarr\u00f3n, Km.2, E-30120 El Palmar, Murcia Spain Article 7 11.2.2003 A436\nStar Ciclo, Montagem Comercializa\u00e7a\u00f5 de Bicicletas Lda Vale do Grou, Aguada de Cima, P-3750-064 \u00c1gueda Portugal Article 7 13.5.2003 A445\nUnited Bicycles NV Oude Bunders 2030, B-3630 Maasmechelen Belgium Article 7 21.5.2003 A467\nSachs Fahrzeug- und Motorentechnik GmbH Nopitschstra\u00dfe 70, D-90441 N\u00fcrnberg Germany Article 7 4.6.2003 A485\nAGECE, Montagem e Com\u00e9rcio de Bicicletas SA Zona Industriale Barr\u00f4, Apartado N. 514, P-3754-909 \u00c1gueda Portugal Article 7 10.6.2003 A466\nPostfach 1020, D-59463 Ense Parsit,\nHauptstra\u00dfe 28, D-59469 Ense Parsit\nOpen Space SRL Via Guido Rossa 18/A, I-35020 Roncaglia de Ponte San Nicolo Italy Article 7 12.9.2003 A486\nIMACycles, Acessori\u00f3rios para Bicicletas e Motociclos Lda Z.I.
