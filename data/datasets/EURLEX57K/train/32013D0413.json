Those conditions should concern the production in areas free from the harmful organism concerned, conduct of surveys of those areas, production from certified seed potatoes, handling, storage, packaging and preparation requirements.\n(5) The potatoes should be introduced into the Union through designated points of entry, to ensure effective controls and reduction of any phytosanitary risk.\n(6) Inspection requirements should be set out to ensure control of the phytosanitary risk.
