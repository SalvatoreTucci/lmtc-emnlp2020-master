The National Fund Department within the Ministry of Public Finance has been appointed for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of Sapard.\n(4) On the basis of a case-by-case analysis of the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance, as provided for in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999, the Commission adopted Decision 2002/638/EC of 31 July 2002\u00a0(3) and Decision 2003/846/EC of 5 December 2003\u00a0(4) conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for pre-accession measures in agriculture and rural development in Romania in the pre-accession period with regard to certain measures provided for in Sapard.\n(5) The Commission has undertaken a further analysis under Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 in respect of measure 1.2 \u2018Improving the structures for quality, veterinary and plant-health controls, for the quality of foodstuffs and consumer protection\u2019; measure 3.2 \u2018Setting-up producers\u2019 groups\u2019; measure 3.3 \u2018Agricultural production methods designed to protect the environment and maintain the countryside\u2019 and measure 3.5 \u2018Forestry\u2019 as provided for in Sapard.
