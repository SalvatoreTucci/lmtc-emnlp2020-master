Such contamination constitutes a threat to public health within the European Union if no measures are taken to avoid the presence of pentachlorophenol and dioxins in guar gum.\n(3) In response to this finding of elevated levels of PCP and dioxins, the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission (FVO) carried out an urgent inspection visit to India in\u00a0October 2007. The objective was to gather information on the possible source of the contamination and to assess the control measures put in place by the Indian authorities to avoid the re-occurrence of this contamination. The inspection team concluded that there was insufficient evidence of the cause of the contamination incident, and the investigation carried out by the Indian authorities was inadequate to provide any conclusions. With availability of sodium pentachlorophenolate and its use in the guar gum industry, and with a largely self regulated industry, there were inadequate controls in place to ensure that this contamination does not occur again.\n(4) Therefore, Commission Decision 2008/352/EC of 29 April 2008 imposing special conditions governing guar gum originating in or consigned from India due to contamination risks of those products by pentachlorophenol and dioxins\u00a0(2) provides that each consignment of guar gum and compound feedingstuffs and foodstuffs containing at least 10\u00a0% guar gum originating in or consigned from India, has to be accompanied by an original analytical report, endorsed by a representative of the competent authority from the country where the laboratory is located, demonstrating that the product does not contain more than 0,01\u00a0mg/kg PCP. The competent authorities in the Member States have to sample and analyse consignments of these products with a frequency of 5\u00a0% in order to verify that the level of 0,01\u00a0mg/kg PCP is not exceeded. The Community Reference Laboratory for Dioxins and PCBs in Feed and Food has carried out a study on the correlation between PCP and dioxins in contaminated guar gum from India. From this study it can be concluded that guar gum containing a level of PCP below the level of 0,01\u00a0mg/kg does not contain unacceptable levels of dioxins.\n(5) A follow-up inspection mission of the FVO took place in October 2009 to assess the control measures put in place by the Indian authorities to prevent contamination of guar gum with PCP and dioxins and to follow-up the recommendations of the mission that took place in October 2007.\n(6) Several serious deficiencies were observed during that inspection mission. The status of PCP in industrial use in India is not clear and at the time of the mission no evidence of any action being taken to stop its production or sale was presented. Samples are taken by the exporting private company without any official supervision. Non-conformities found by the laboratory at a frequency of about 2,5\u00a0% of samples analysed are notified to the exporting company without notifying the competent authority. As there was no knowledge on the part of the competent authority of these non-compliances, no action was taken regarding the non-conforming lots.\n(7) The findings indicate that the contamination of guar gum with PCP and/or dioxins cannot be regarded as an isolated incident and that only the effective analysis by the approved private laboratory has prevented contaminated product being further exported to the European Union. Taking into account that there has been no improvement in the control system additional measures should be taken in order to reduce possible risks.\n(8) Given that it cannot be excluded that guar gum originating in India is exported to the EU via another third country, it is appropriate to foresee random controls on the presence of PCP in guar gum consigned from countries other than India.\n(9) Therefore, Decision 2008/352/EC should be amended accordingly. However, taking into account the nature of the amending provisions, which have a direct application and are binding in their entirety, it is appropriate to replace that Decision with a Regulation.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to:\n(a) guar gum, falling within CN code 1302\u00a032\u00a090, originating in or consigned from India, and intended for animal or human consumption;\n(b) feed and food containing at least 10\u00a0% guar gum originating in or consigned from India.", "Certification\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each consignment of the products referred to in Article 1 presented for import shall be accompanied by:\n(a) a health certificate, provided in the Annex, certifying that the product imported does not contain more than 0,01 mg/kg pentachlorophenol (PCP) and\n(b) an analytical report, issued by a laboratory accredited according to EN ISO/IEC 17025 for the analysis of PCP in feed and food, indicating the results of sampling and analysis for the presence of PCP, the measurement uncertainty of the analytical result, as well as the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the analytical method.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The certificate accompanied by an analytical report shall be signed by an authorised representative of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India and the validity of the certificate shall not exceed 4 months from the date of its issue.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The analysis referred to in paragraph 1(b) must be performed on a sample, taken by the competent Indian authorities from the consignment in accordance with the provisions of Commission Directive 2002/63/EC of 11\u00a0July 2002 establishing Community methods of sampling for the official control of pesticide residues in and on products of plant and animal origin and repealing Directive 79/700/EEC\u00a0(3).
