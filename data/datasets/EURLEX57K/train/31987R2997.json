This special aid shall be given for a total area of no more than 800 hectares in each Member State concerned.\n2. The Member State concerned may make a financial contribution to the conversion plan referred to in paragraph 1. However, the aid granted by the Member State, plus the special aid indicated in paragraph 1, may not exceed 50 % of the actual cost of the conversion plan.
