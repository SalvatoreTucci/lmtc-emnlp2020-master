Commission Regulation (EC) No 109/2007\u00a0(2) authorised that additive for ten years for use for chickens for fattening and turkey, linking the authorisation to the holder of authorisation for putting that additive into circulation.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility of modifying the authorisation of an additive further to a request from the holder of the authorisation and an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019).\n(3) The holder of the authorisation of the feed additive monensin sodium (Coxidin) has submitted an application with which it proposes changing the terms of the authorisation by reducing the withdrawal period before slaughter and by establishing the final Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs).\n(4) In its opinion adopted on 18 June 2008\u00a0(3), the Authority concluded, after re-assessing human exposure, that a one-day withdrawal time for Coxidin for chickens for fattening and turkeys could be set. No new data was provided by the holder of the authorisation which would allow the Authority to propose a final MRL.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 109/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 109/2007 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a031, 6.2.2007, p.\u00a06.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) on a request from the European Commission on the withdrawal period for Coxidin for chickens and turkeys for fattening and the re-examination of the provisional Maximum Residue Limit.
