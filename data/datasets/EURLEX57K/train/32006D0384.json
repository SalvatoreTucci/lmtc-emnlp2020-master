After notification of those measures, the Commission has examined them in collaboration with the Member State concerned, and is satisfied that areas A and B established by that Member State are at sufficient distance to the outbreak in poultry. It is therefore necessary to establish areas A and B in Denmark and to fix the duration of that regionalisation.\n(3) Taking account of Article 2(4)(b) and (c) of Decision 2006/135/EC and a final evaluation of the epidemiological situation with regard to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in certain parts of Sweden and Germany, the measures established for those areas in accordance with Article 2(2) of that Decision are no longer necessary.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to amend Parts A and B of Annex I to Decision 2006/135/EC accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2006/135/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 May 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.
