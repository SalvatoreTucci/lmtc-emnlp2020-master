Hence, the closure phase and relevant provisions should be adapted accordingly.\n(3) Provision should be made for a clause enabling the Commission to agree on the extension of the execution period of a joint operational programme after a reasoned request from the Joint Monitoring Committee in the event of unforeseen and duly justified needs or circumstances.\n(4) The effective handling of irregularities is essential in order to protect Union's financial interests and ensure the principle of sound financial management of the programmes. In this vein and given that financial corrections are the main tool used to restore irregularities concerning expenditure financed by the Union under shared management, relevant provisions on financial corrections should be introduced in the Regulation (EC) No 951/2007.\n(5) In order to provide legal certainty for participating countries, it is appropriate to lay down the specific arrangements and procedures for financial corrections by the Joint Managing Authorities, respecting the principles of equal treatment, transparency and proportionality.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 951/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Regulation (EU) No 232/2014 of the European Parliament and of Council\u00a0(4).", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 951/2007 is amended as follows:\n1.
