The additional measures specified in 2 (a) and (b) of the Annex shall apply only to consignments leaving Egypt after the Commission has informed Egypt of these measures.", "The importing Member States shall provide the Commission and the other Member States, before 30 November 1996, with information on the amounts imported pursuant to this Decision and with a detailed technical report on the official examination referred to in point 3 of the Annex; copies of each plant health certificate shall be transmitted to the Commission.", "The Member States shall adjust the measures which they have adopted with a view to protecting themselves against the introduction and spread of Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith in such a manner that the measures comply with Article 1.", "This Decision shall be reviewed by 30 November 1996 at the latest.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 May 1996.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 26, 31. 1. 1977, p. 20.\n(2) OJ No L 68, 19. 3. 1996, p. 24.\nANNEX\nFor the purpose of the provisions of Article 1, the following additional measures shall be complied with:\n1.

(a) the potatoes destined for introduction into the Community shall have been, in Egypt:\n- officially inspected, on cut tubers of samples of at least 200 tubers each, taken from each lot or, if the lot exceeds 25 tonnes, from every 25 tonnes or part thereof in such a lot, immediately prior to shipment, for symptoms of potato brown rot caused by Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith and found free from such symptoms in these inspections,\n- officially tested, in accordance with an appropriate method specified by the Commission, for latent infection on samples taken from each consignment, and found free from Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith in such testing; one sample per area as specified in 1 (i) and represented in the consignment must be taken, but in any case at least five samples must be taken,\n- harvested, handled and bagged separately, including reasonably separate use of machinery, basin by basin, wherever possible, and in any case area by area as specified in 1 (i),\n- prepared in lots, each of which shall be made up exclusively by potatoes which were harvested in one single area as specified in 1 (i),\n- clearly labelled, on each bag, with an indelible indication of the relevant official code number as given in the 'list of qualified areas`, and of the relevant lot number,\n- accompanied by the official phytosanitary certificate required under Article 12 (1) (b) of Directive 77/93/EEC indicating the lot number(s) under the section 'Distinguishing marks`, and the official code number(s), as referred to in the previous indent, under the section 'Additional declaration`; the lot number of the lot from which a sample has been taken for the purpose specified in the second indent above, as well as the official statement that the testing has been carried out, shall also be indicated in that section;\n(b) the points of entry authorized for the introduction of relevant potatoes and the name and address of the responsible official body in charge of each point shall have been notified by the Member States to the Commission, which will inform the other Member States and Egypt thereof;\n(c) the responsible official body in charge of the point of entry should have received advanced notification of the likely time of arrival of consignments of potatoes as well as of the amount thereof. In absence of any advance notification, the provisions of Article 5 (4) of Council Directive 83/643/EEC (1), as last amended by Directive 91/342/EEC (2), shall apply;\n3. at the point of entry, the potatoes shall be subjected to the inspections required pursuant to Article 12 of Directive 77/93/EEC, and such inspections, comprising at least inspections of the type as specified in 2 (a), first indent, shall be done on each lot in a consignment.\nThose inspections shall be completed by testing, in accordance with an appropriate method, for latent infection on samples taken from each consignment; one sample per area as specified in 1 (i) and represented in the consignment must be taken, but in any case at least five samples must be taken.\nThe lots concerned shall remain separate under official control and may not be marketed or used until it has been established that the presence of Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith was not suspected or detected in those examinations;\n4. the Commission shall ensure that it receives information of the details and the results of the testing referred to in 2 (a) second indent. The 'list of qualified areas` shall be adjusted by the Commission according to these results and to the findings made under 3;\n5. Member States shall lay down appropriate labelling requirements with the aim of preventing the potatoes from being planted.\n(1) OJ No L 359, 22. 12. 1983, p. 8.\n(2) OJ No L 187, 13. 7. 1991, p. 47."}
