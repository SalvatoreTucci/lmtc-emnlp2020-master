This programme is ongoing and it has not been possible yet to complete decision-making on a number of active substances.\n(3) The Commission presented its progress report on 26 July 2001(4). It concluded that progress has not been as good as was originally anticipated and therefore the deadline should be extended for those active substances for which industry has notified a commitment to prepare further the necessary dossiers within the time limits.\n(4) For those active substances the time period provided for in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC should be prolonged in order to allow for the submission of dossiers and the evaluation thereof.\n(5) This extension of time does not prejudge the possibility of including or not including individual active substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414 as provided for in Article 8(2), fourth subparagraph, of that Directive.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The time period of 12 years provided for in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC is extended until 31 December 2008 for the active substances listed in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 July 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 177, 16.7.2003, p. 12.\n(3) OJ L 168, 27.6.2002, p. 14.\n(4) COM(2001) 444 final.\nANNEX\nLIST OF ACTIVE SUBSTANCES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 1\nA.
