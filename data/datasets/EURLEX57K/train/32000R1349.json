The Council approved the abovementioned Protocol on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 1999/86/EC(3).\n(3) In accordance with the directives adopted by the Council on 30 March 1999, the Commission and the Republic of Estonia concluded on 22 November 1999 negotiations on a new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement.\n(4) The new Additional Protocol, which provides for additional agricultural concessions, will be based on Article 19(4) of the Europe Agreement, establishing that the Community and Estonia are to examine in the Association Council, product by product and on an orderly and reciprocal basis, the possibility of granting each other further concessions.\n(5) The Republic of Estonia already applies zero-duties for imports of agricultural products originating in the Community. When Estonia on 1 January 2000 introduced tariffs on imports of agricultural products from other third countries, additional preferences were created for Community exports of agricultural products.\n(6) A swift implementation of the adjustments forms an essential part of the results of the negotiations for the conclusion of a new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement with Estonia.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to provide for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of the agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Estonia.\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999, laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4),", "main_body": ["1.

On the entry into force of the new Additional Protocol adjusting the Europe Agreement referred to in paragraph 1, the concessions provided for in that Protocol shall replace those referred to in Annex A(a) and A(b) to this Regulation.\n3.

In the case of a customs declaration value being lower than the minimum import price, a countervailing duty will be charged equal to the difference between the minimum import price and the customs declaration value.\n3. If the import prices of a given product covered by this Annex show a trend suggesting that the prices could go below the level of the minimum import prices in the immediate future, the European Commission will inform the Estonian authorities in order to enable them to correct the situation.\n4. At the request of either the Community or Estonia, the Association Council shall examine the functioning of the system or the revision of the level of the minimum import prices. If appropriate, the Association Council shall take the necessary decisions.\n5. To encourage and promote the development of trade and for the mutual benefit of all parties concerned, a consultation meeting will be organised three months before the beginning of each marketing year in the European Community. This consultation meeting will take place between the European Commission and the interested European producers' organisations for the products concerned, on the one part and the authorities', producers' and exporters' organisations of all the associated exporting countries, on the other part.\nDuring this consultation meeting, the market situation for soft fruit including, in particular, forecasts for production, stock situation, price evolution and possible market development, as well as possibilities to adapt supply to demand, will be discussed."}
