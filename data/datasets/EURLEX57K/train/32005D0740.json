That Decision suspends the importation of birds, other than poultry, from Russia.\n(3) In addition, Decision 2005/693/EC suspends the importation of unprocessed feathers and unprocessed parts of feathers from those regions of Russian listed in Annex I to that Decision. However, the importation of unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers, are still authorised from those regions of Russia not listed in Annex I to that Decision, subject to certain conditions, including those regions located west of the Ural mountains, in which outbreaks had not occurred at the date of adoption of Decision 2005/693/EC.\n(4) On 19 October 2005, Russia informed the Commission that an outbreak of avian influenza has occurred in Tula, in the Central Federal District of Russia, in which no outbreaks had been previously reported and from which unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers may still be imported, in accordance with Decision 2005/693/EC.\n(5) In relation to the recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 in Turkey, Romania and Russia, circumstantial evidence and molecular epidemiology data strongly suggest that the avian influenza virus has spread into those third countries proceeding from central Asia via migratory birds. This is also suggested by the report of a recent mission to Russia carried out by the World Organization for Animal Health (O.I.E.), that was published on 14 October 2005.\n(6) The importation into the Community of unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers should therefore be banned from those regions of Russia where the outbreak of avian influenza has recently occurred or which are at particular risk, in accordance with current knowledge on the flyways of migratory brids proceeding from the areas in central Asia and Siberia where the disease has been recorded.\n(7) Annex I to Commission Decision 2005/693/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex I of Decision 2005/693/EC the following points 4, 5, 6 and 7 are added:\n\u20184.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Central Federal District\nIncludes the following Subjects of the Russian Federation: Belgorod Oblast, Bryansk Oblast, Ivanovo Oblast, Kaluga Oblast, Kostroma Oblast, Kursk Oblast, Lipetsk Oblast, Moscow (federal city), Moscow Oblast, Oryol Oblast, Ryazan Oblast, Smolensk Oblast, Tambov Oblast, Tver Oblast, Tula Oblast, Vladimir Oblast, Voronezh Oblast, Yaroslavl Oblast.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Southern Federal District\nIncludes the following Subjects of the Russian Federation: Adygeya Republic, Astrakhan Oblast, Chechnya Republic, Dagestan Republic, Ingushetia Republic, Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, Kalmykia Republic, Karachay-Cherkessia Republic, Krasnodar Krai, North Ossetia-Alania Republic, Stavropol Krai, Rostov Oblast, Volgograd Oblast.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Northwestern Federal District\nIncludes the following Subjects of the Russian Federation: Arkhangelsk Oblast, Komi Republic, Novgorod Oblast, Pskov Oblast, Vologda Oblast.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Privolzhsky (Volga) Federal District\nIncludes the following Subjects of the Russian Federation: Bashkortostan Republic, Chuvashia Republic, Kirov Oblast, Mari El Republic, Mordovia Republic, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Orenburg Oblast, Penza Oblast, Perm Oblast, Permyakia Autonomous District, Samara Oblast, Saratov Oblast, Tatarstan Republic, Udmurtia Republic, Ulyanovsk Oblast.\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 56.
