Moreover, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3083/73 of 14 November 1973 on the communication of the information necessary for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 on the common organisation of the market in seeds\u00a0(3) has been amended several times. For the sake of clarity it is necessary to replace that Regulation by a new text. Regulation (EEC) No 3083/73 should therefore be repealed.\n(2) Given the changed situation of the market for hybrid maize and sorghum for sowing, it is no longer necessary to be able to monitor continuously trade patterns with third countries. Hybrid maize and sorghum for sowing should no longer be subject to the system of import licences under Article 4(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71. It is therefore appropriate to repeal Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1117/79 of 6 June 1979 specifying the products in the seeds sector to be subject to the system of import licences\u00a0(4) and to no longer provide for the corresponding data communication.\n(3) The Management Committee for seeds has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Member States shall communicate to the Commission by electronic transmission, for each species and group of varieties set out in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71, the information listed in the Annex to this Regulation by the dates specified therein.", "Regulation (EEC) No 3083/73 and Regulation (EEC) No 1117/79 are repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 246, 5.11.1971, p. 1.
