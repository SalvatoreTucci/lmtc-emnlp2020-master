In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) The United States of America applies special arrangements for an annual quantity of 5\u00a0000 tonnes of beef and veal originating in the Community and meeting certain requirements. One of the requirements is that this meat must be accompanied by a certificate of identity issued by the exporting Member State.\n(3) The certificates of identity are to be issued solely for the 5\u00a0000 tonnes qualifying for the special arrangements. It is therefore necessary to provide for Commission authorisation before the issue of an export licence for the meat in question. Furthermore, the tolerance provided for in Article 8(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(5) should not be applied for the quantity exceeding that for which the licence has been issued.\n(4) It is necessary to define the nature of the identity certificates, and the necessary procedures for using them.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation establishes detailed rules of application in respect of exports to the United States of America of 5\u00a0000 tonnes per year of beef and veal of Community origin, fresh, chilled or frozen, qualifying for special treatment.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The meat referred to in paragraph 1 must comply with the health protection requirements laid down by the importing third country and relate to animals slaughtered not more than two months in advance of clearance through customs for export.", "When the meat is being cleared through customs for export, the certificate of identity defined in Article 3 shall be issued, at the applicant\u2019s request, on presentation of the export licence referred to in Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95\u00a0(6) and a veterinary certificate showing the date of slaughter of the animals from which the meat applied for under Article 12 of that Regulation derives.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The certificate of identity shall be made out, with at least one copy, on a form corresponding to the specimen in Annex I.\nThe certificate shall be printed in English on white paper measuring 210 \u00d7 297 mm.
