Following their accession to the European Union on 1 May 2004, those countries lost the benefit of the aid provided by that Regulation. Consequently, in the period from 2004 to 2006 only Bulgaria and Romania will continue to benefit from commitments under that Regulation.\n(2) By endorsing the roadmaps for Bulgaria and Romania, as proposed by the Commission, the Copenhagen European Council agreed to fix the ratio for the division (30\u00a0% and 70\u00a0% respectively) of the aid under the Phare programme set up pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 of 18 December 1989 on economic aid to the Republic of Hungary and the Polish People\u2019s Republic\u00a0(2), the special accession programme for agriculture and rural development (Sapard) set up under Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 and the Instrument for Structural Policies for Preaccession (ISPA), set up pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999\u00a0(3).\n(3) That ratio takes account of the need and capacity for absorbing assistance referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 as well as the criteria for the financial allocation to each applicant country as stipulated in Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(4) The Council, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999, is to adopt the general approach for reallocation of the available financial resources for the Sapard instrument between the remaining beneficiary countries, namely Romania and Bulgaria,", "main_body": ["For the period 2004 to 2006, the division between Romania and Bulgaria of resources available by virtue of the commitments entered into pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 shall be established at a rate of 70\u00a0% for Romania and 30\u00a0% for Bulgaria."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
