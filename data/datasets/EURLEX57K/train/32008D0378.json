(the pinewood nematode \u2014 PWN) as regards areas in Portugal, other than those in which it is known not to occur\u00a0(2), Portugal has taken measures against the dissemination of the pinewood nematode.\n(2) Portugal has sent a report to the Commission on 11 April 2008 on the finding of new outbreaks of PWN, as a result from an extraordinary investigation by the Portuguese authorities in addition to the annual survey, in the part of Portugal where so far PWN was known not to occur.\n(3) The compulsory annual surveys of previous years had not revealed these latest outbreaks of PWN in Portugal. In view of this new outbreak, it is necessary that Portugal carries out immediately an additional risk-based survey in the entire Portuguese territory on the basis of a survey plan approved by the Commission and that it presents the results of that survey to the Commission as soon as they are available.\n(4) Based on the experience with the implementation of the existing emergency measures and recent scientific information, it is necessary to take particularly effective measures with respect to outbreaks in areas where so far PWN was known not to occur.\n(5) Decision 2006/133/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/133/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
