The characteristics of the soil impose a limit on the crops which can be grown and the limited changes to the physical nature of the land allowed for the growing of basil are motivated solely by the special technique of harvesting the plants, which must be done without damaging them. Any soil improvement is an important factor in crop management because it may solve limited and well defined drainage problems even if it appears not to contribute to the typical nature of the finished product. The daily changes in temperature have a direct influence on the choice of crops, as do the availability and quality of water, light and wind. The configuration of the territory of Liguria favours the cultivation of basil since its long axis lies along parallels, with crops enjoying sunlight for many hours, even in winter, on south-facing slopes which also provide protection from cold north, easterly and westerly winds through its unique curvature while also benefiting from the regulatory effect of the sea.\nIt is the climatic conditions of Liguria themselves, with their high levels of light even in winter, temperatures which rarely drop below 10\u00a0\u00b0C and a steady stream of air tempered by the sea, which combine with the chemical and physical characteristics of the land and the technical knowledge and traditions of the farmers to create a final product whose aromas cannot be found in the same combination and degree in basil grown elsewhere.\nAlthough the climate of the Ligurian hinterland is similar to that of lower Lazio and Campania and the origin of the soil where basil is grown is the same as that of lower Piedmont, Piedmont has a typically continental climate while the soils of central Italy are different from those of Liguria. This makes the combination of climate and soil for the grower in Liguria inimitable and special.\nAttesting to the importance of these crops for the economy of the region, we have the yearbooks of Italian agriculture and other documents, which described this situation vividly and in detail. Even today basil still accounts for a large part of agriculture and cultivation in Liguria. \u2018Basilico Genovese\u2019 is a unique and inimitable blend of territory, surroundings and cultivation.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe characteristics of \u2018Basilico Genovese\u2019, the complete absence of minty odour, a very intense and pleasant perfume and the particularly delicate colouring of the leaves are the result of certain features of the soil and climate of Liguria.\nAlthough basil is a minor crop in national and international terms, at regional level it is an important source of income for many farms which produce it under glass all the year round and in open fields in summer. As long ago as the 1920s and 1930s, international horticultural fairs and exhibitions were held at Finale Ligure where early crops grown under glass from the entire region, including basil, received the highest honours.\nComparing basil plants from Liguria with those from other areas shows that the yield of essential basil oil from Liguria is markedly different from that from basil grown elsewhere, this yield rising by a statistically significant extent from basil grown throughout its growing cycle in Liguria to that grown elsewhere in Italy.\nEven the composition of the essential oil is different, as are the proportions of the various substances, so that the aroma is clearly distinguishable.\nBasil which has been grown throughout its cycle in Liguria can be clearly distinguished from that grown elsewhere.\nTaking account of the substances present in larger quantities, or those whose presence, even in small amounts, can affect the final aroma of the basil leaf, makes it possible to clearly distinguish basil grown in Liguria from that from elsewhere. The special aroma of \u2018Basilico Genovese\u2019 and its quality features cannot derive other than from Liguria. Basil grown in Piedmont or the other regions bordering on Liguria smells of mint, while that grown further south is considerably less delicate.\n\u2018Basilico Genovese\u2019, on the other hand, is a delicate crop immediately distinguishable by its intense and persistent perfume, by the total absence of any minty odour, and by its delicate leaf colour, present even after successive processing. The characteristics are typical and consistent in all basil produced in the production area covered by the specification.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nBasil is one of the most representative and typical crops of Liguria and symbolises a style of cooking using traditional flavours, resulting from the unique combination of territory, surroundings and cultivation.\n\u2018Basilico Genovese\u2019 has been grown for centuries and has enjoyed unprecedented popularity among consumers in Italy and beyond, who appreciate ever more the aromas contributing to flavoursome dishes and because \u2018Basilico Genovese\u2019 stands for the quality, simplicity and typical character of a region and its culture.\nThe original centre of production was limited to the geographical area of Genoa. Given the increasingly favourable market conditions for the large-scale consumption of basil in the preparation of many recipes and the well known pesto, the production area has widened, taking in the entire Ligurian coastline.\nStarting from the area around Genoa, the area of production has expanded both eastwards and westwards, making the territory of Liguria the ideal area for obtaining a characteristic product.\nThe entire region of Liguria is given over to growing basil on account of its environmental, cultivation and human characteristics, which give the fresh and the processed product its unique character, which is well known and recognised all over the world.\nBasil is a plant species much influenced by its environment. This explains why basil grown in Liguria distinguishes itself by its homogenous quality, determined by whether it is grown under glass or in the open, cultivation and post-harvesting processing techniques.\nThe combination of soil characteristics, sun exposure and the particularly mild climate of the region, a climate in which the sea breeze plays a major role, gives this production area its unique character.\nIn this exceptional region specific technical skills have been developed to maximise the natural characteristics of the product and ensure a high and consistent level of quality, regardless of the time of year.\nThe skills of local growers are not limited to the cultivation method but also cover the subsequent packing phase, enabling them to avoid any alteration to the specific characteristics of the product thanks to a perfect blend of tradition and innovation (application of integrated pest management).\nReference to the publication of the specification\nThe Ministry launched the national objection procedure with the publication of the proposal for recognising \u2018Basilico Genovese\u2019 as a protected designation of origin in Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No 108 of 12 May 2009.\nThe full text of the product specification is available on the following website: www.politicheagricole.it/DocumentiPubblicazioni/Search_Documenti_Elenco.htm?txtTipoDocumento=Disciplinare%20in%20esame%20UE&txtDocArgomento=Prodotti%20di%20Qualit%E0>Prodotti%20Dop,%20Igp%20e%20Stg\nor by going directly to the home page of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy (www.politicheagricole.it) and clicking on \u2018Prodotti di Qualit\u00e0\u2019 [Quality products] (on the left of the screen) and finally on \u2018Disciplinari di Produzione all\u2019esame dell\u2019UE\u2019 (Reg.
