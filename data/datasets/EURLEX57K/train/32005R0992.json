Once the ongoing XXIV.6 negotiations have been finalised and ratified, new management rules will be implemented. Those rules should take into account the results of those negotiations and the quantities already used within the quota hereby opened.\n(4) In order to provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, each application of import licences should respect a minimum and a maximum number of heads.\n(5) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in import of a significant scale from third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 100 animals during the period 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005 given that a consignment of 100 animals may be considered to be a commercial viable consignment.\n(6) If such criteria should to be checked, applications must be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.\n(7) In order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2005 should be denied access to the quota and licences should not be transferable.\n(8) Provision should be made for quantities for which licence applications may be requested to be allocated after a period of consideration and, where appropriate, once a uniform percentage reduction has been applied.\n(9) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by addition of certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(2) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(3).\n(10) Experience shows that a proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security.\n(11) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should not apply.\n(12) The application of this tariff quota requires effective checks on the specific destination of the imported animals. The animals should therefore be fattened in the Member State which has issued the import licence.\n(13) A security should be lodged to ensure that the animals are fattened for at least 120 days in designated production units. The amount of the security should cover the difference between the common customs tariff (CCT) duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals in question.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A tariff quota for 169\u00a0000 young male bovine animals falling within CN code 0102\u00a090\u00a005, 0102\u00a090\u00a029 or 0102\u00a090\u00a049 and intended for fattening in the Community is hereby opened for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 subject to any reductions negotiated subsequently between the Community and its WTO partners within the framework of the negotiations under Article XXIV.6 GATT in the context of the WTO.\nThis tariff quota shall have the order number 09.4005.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The customs import duty applicable under the tariff quota referred to in paragraph 1 shall be 16\u00a0% ad valorem plus EUR\u00a0582 per tonne net.\nThe rate of duty provided for in the first subparagraph shall apply on condition that the imported animals are fattened for at least 120 days in the Member State which has issued the import licence.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantities referred under paragraph 1 shall be staggered over the period referred to in that paragraph as follows:\n(a) 42\u00a0250 live bovine animals for the period 1 July to 30 September 2005;\n(b) 42\u00a0250 live animals for the period 1 October to 31 December 2005;\n(c) 42\u00a0250 live animals for the period 1 January to 31 March 2006;\n(d) 42\u00a0250 live animals for the period 1 April to 30 June 2006.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, during one of the periods mentioned under paragraphs 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c), the quantity covered by licence applications submitted for each of these periods is less than the quantity available for the period in question, the remaining quantity of that period will be added to the quantity available for the following period.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be eligible under the quota provided for in Article 1, applicants must be natural or legal persons and must prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the Member State concerned, at the time they submit their applications for import licences, that they have imported at least 100 animals covered by CN code 0102\u00a090 during the period 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005.\nApplicants must be listed in a national VAT register.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of import shall be furnished exclusively by means of the customs document of release for free circulation, duly endorsed by the customs authorities and containing a reference to the applicant concerned as being the consignee.\nMember States may accept copies of the documents referred to in the first subparagraph, duly certified by the competent authority.
