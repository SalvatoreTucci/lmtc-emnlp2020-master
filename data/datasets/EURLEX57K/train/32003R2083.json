Articles 14, 15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund, in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods' arrival at destination.\n(3) In the case of a differentiated refund, Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest refund rate, is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.\n(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(7) provides, on an autonomous basis, for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Malta, from 1 November 2003.\n(5) Malta has undertaken to grant the preferential import arrangements to goods imported into their territories only if the goods concerned are accompanied by documents stating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds.\n(6) In the light of these arrangements, as a transitory measure pending the accession to the European Union of Malta and, in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries, it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate, where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question, not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, read in conjunction with Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, where the differentiation of the refund is the result solely of a refund not having been fixed for Malta, in respect of exports to other third countries, proof that the customs import formalities have been completed shall not be a condition for payment of the refund in respect of all goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, which are covered by the arrangements for Malta.", "The fact that no export refund has been fixed in respect of the export to Malta of the goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, which are covered by the arrangements for Malta, shall not, in respect of exports to other third countries, be taken into account in determining the lowest rate of refund within the meaning of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt is applicable from 1 November 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 November 2003.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 318, 20.12.1993, p. 18.\n(2) OJ L 298, 25.11.2000, p. 5.\n(3) OJ L 177, 15.7.2000, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 106, 29.4.2003, p. 12.\n(5) OJ L 102, 17.4.1999, p. 11.\n(6) OJ L 297, 15.11.2003, p. 13.\n(7) OJ L 278, 29.10.2003, p. 1."}
