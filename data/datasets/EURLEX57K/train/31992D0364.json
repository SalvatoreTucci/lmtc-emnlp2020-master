GENERAL REMARKS  The programme concerns the whole of the Irish fleet and covers the entire territory of that Member State.\nII. OBJECTIVES  1. The objectives of the programme should be:\n(a) to reduce the fishing fleet to 43 062 GRT and 174 024 kW, according to the provisions set out in point II.2;\n(b) to modernize existing vessels where there is no increase in global capacity of the category expressed in gross registered tonnage and engine power.\n2. The evolution of the fishing fleet with the exception of:\n- aquaculture working vessels,\n- vessels engaged exclusively in bivalve fishing,\nduring the period covered by the programme should be made within the following limits:\nTonnage  (in GRT)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nVessels less than 12\n7 000\n6 790\n6 654 (\u00b2)\nVessels 12 m and more\n38 300\n37 151\n36 408 (\u00b2)\nTotal A\n45 300\n58 845\n50 693\n57 355\n49 903\n43 941\n43 062\nVessels used for aquaculture and bivale fishing\nTotal B\n(\u00b9) Includes vessels under construction at 1 January 1987.\n(\u00b2) Some flexibility can be allowed between these segments of the fleet.\nEngine power  (in kW)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nVessels less than 12 m\n28 000\n27 440\n26 891 (\u00b2)\nVessels of 12 m and more\n153 200\n150 136\n147 133 (\u00b2)\nTotal A\n181 200\n234 892\n191 604\n229 160\n200 502\n177 576\n174 024\nVessels used for aquaculture and bivalve fishing\nTotal B\n(\u00b9) Includes vessels under construction at 1 January 1987.\n(\u00b2) Some flexibility can be allowed between these segments of the fleet.\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. While the objectives in point II.2, Total A fix a reduction in the fishing fleet capacity equal to the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the objectives to be achieved by 31 December 1992, it is also  necessary to take into account the balance of capacity, if any, resulting from:\n- those projects for new construction having benefited from Community and national aids at the 1991 tranches,\n- those projects for new vessel construction presently under examination by the Commission (\u00b9),\n- the balance of exits and entries from the fleet carried out during 1992 and not taken into account in the preceding lines,\nwhich additions give the total reduction in fishing fleet capacity required.\n1.2. The reductions envisaged in point III.1.1, should be achieved by implementing the following actions in so far as the entry into service of surplus fishing capacity having been incorporated in the capacity limits of this programme and being intended  that the reductions envisaged for each of the actions can be varied on condition that the total volume of reduction of fishing capacity set out in point III.1.1 is respected:\n- a reduction in the total fleet, by renewal of those active vessels lost by accident at sea, sinking or otherwise by linking direct withdrawals to new construction in line with the achievement of the objectives for fleet capacity envisaged in point  II.2,\n- the adoption and implementation of direct measures intended to adapt fishing capacity,\n- any other measures that will achieve the same results.\n2. Adoption and implementation of comprehensive legislation and/or administrative measures in order to control effectively the active fishing capacity and fishing operations and consequently to achieve the objectives of the programme set out in point  II.2.\nIV. COMMENTS  1. The objectives for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of the programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 1991 which were achieved  by Member States (\u00b2) can be taken into account in 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while the  remaining maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n3. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n(\u00b9) The withdrawal of requests for financing of projects currently being exmaninned by the Commission will allow for adjustment of the total reduction required.\n(\u00b2) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987-1991."}
