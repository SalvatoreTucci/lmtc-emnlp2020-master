In some cases, the common understanding shared between the Commission and the competent authorities designated in accordance with Article 26 of Directive 98/8/EC has changed over time. In particular, the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 1 March 2012 in case C-420/10, S\u00f6ll GmbH v Tetra GmbH\n\u00a0(4), clarified that the concept of \u2018biocidal products\u2019 must be interpreted as including certain products which act only by indirect means on the target harmful organisms.\n(4) Persons relying on guidance notes published, or written advice given, by the Commission or by a competent authority designated in accordance with Article 26 of Directive 98/8/EC may therefore have failed to notify the existing active substance/product-type combination in a product placed on the market, or to take over the role of participant, in the objectively justified belief that the product is excluded from the scope of Directive 98/8/EC or that it falls under a different product-type.\n(5) Those persons should have the possibility of submitting a dossier for examination under the review programme in such cases, subject, where relevant, to prior notification, in order to avoid the market withdrawal of products for which a justified interpretation as regards its character as a biocidal product or its correct product-type is subsequently contested by Member States or the Commission.\n(6) In addition, in cases where, for the same reasons, active substances have not yet been identified as existing, Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 should be updated to correctly reflect all existing active substances.\n(7) The situation of persons wishing to notify an active substance/product-type combination on the basis of this Regulation will be similar to that of persons wishing to take over the role of participant in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007. It is therefore appropriate to provide for similar procedure and deadlines for informing stakeholders and allowing declarations of intention to the Commission.\n(8) Furthermore, it is appropriate to align the deadlines and other requirements for notification with those set out in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000 for the first notifications of existing active substances to the extent possible, while taking account of the current working methods of the European Chemicals Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5).\n(9) In cases where no Rapporteur Member State has been designated for the active substance concerned by a notification, and in order to ensure that the substance will be evaluated for approval, confirmation is to be required from the notifier that a competent authority agrees to evaluate the forthcoming application for approval of the active substance.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) In order to ensure a smooth transition from Directive 98/8/EC to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products\u00a0(6), certain parts of this Regulation should apply from the same date as Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 2, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Article 3(2), the following point (d) is added:\n\u2018(d) existing active substances notified in accordance with Article 3b.\u2019;\n(3) the following Article 3a is inserted:\n(4) the following Article 3b is inserted:\n(5) the following Article 3c is inserted:\n(a) where the active substance/product-type combination concerned is not included in Annex II to this Regulation, include the active substance/product-type combination therein and, where relevant, the active substance in Annex I to this Regulation;\n(b) where the active substance/product-type combination concerned is included in Annex II to this Regulation but has been the subject of a Commission decision not to include it in Annex I or IA of Directive 98/8/EC, annul that decision.\n(6) in Article 4, the following paragraph 4 is added:\n(7) in Article 9, the following paragraph 3 is added:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nHowever, points 2, 4 and 7 of Article 1 shall apply from 1 September 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 June 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 325, 11.12.2007, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 228, 8.9.2000, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Not yet published in the European Court Reports.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, p. 1.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, p. 1.\u2019;"}
