Without prejudice to the application of Article 12 to preferential sugar, paragraph 2 shall not apply to this sugar for the marketing years 1982/83 to 1984/85.\nIn the calculation of the amount of the levy applicable to the said sugar, and by way of derogation from the financing principle referred to in paragraph 1, the total estimated reimbursements for the 1985/86 marketing year shall be reduced by the negative balance on 30 June 1982 resulting from the application of paragraph 2 to preferential sugar up to an amount of 2;045 million ECU.'", "The following point shall be added to Article 8 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81:\n'(c) before 1 May 1985, and on the basis of a report by the Commission, examine the consequences of the application of paragraph 2a and shall, if necessary, adopt the appropriate measures.'\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 March 1982.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP. de KEERSMAEKER\n(1) OJ No C 346, 31. 12. 1981, p. 5.\n(2) OJ No C 66, 15. 3. 1982, p. 110.\n(3) OJ No L 177, 1. 7. 1981, p. 4.\n(4) OJ No L 21, 29. 1. 1982, p. 1.\n(5) OJ No L 347, 22. 12. 1980, p. 144.\n(6) OJ No L 190, 23. 7. 1975, p. 36.\n(7) OJ No L 361, 31. 12. 1980, p. 1."}
