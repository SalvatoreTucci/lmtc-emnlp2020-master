It endorsed the Council's conclusions of 16 June 2003, including the Annex entitled \"The Thessaloniki Agenda for the western Balkans: moving towards European integration\". The \"Thessaloniki Agenda\" identifies ways and means of intensifying the stabilisation and association process, including the drawing-up of European partnerships.\n(4) Under the Thessaloniki Declaration of the EU-Western Balkans Summit of 21 June 2003, the \"Thessaloniki Agenda\" is considered to be a shared agenda between the European Union and the western Balkan countries, which they commit themselves to implement. The enriched stabilisation and association process remains the overall framework for the European course of the western Balkan countries, all the way to their accession.\n(5) The European partnerships for the western Balkan countries will identify priorities for action in order to support efforts to move closer to the European Union while serving as a checklist against which to measure progress. They will be adapted to the countries' specific needs and respective stages of preparation, and to the specificities of the stabilisation and association process, including regional cooperation. Informal consultations will be held with the countries and, as appropriate, with the wider international community in preparing the European partnerships.\n(6) The European partnerships, updated as necessary, are needed in order to assist the western Balkan countries in preparing for membership within a coherent framework and in developing plans with timetables of reforms and details in terms of measures of how they intend to address the requirements for further integration into the European Union.\n(7) It would be appropriate for Community assistance to focus on the challenges to be defined within the framework of the European partnerships, which will provide guidance for financial assistance, and which will observe defined principles, priorities and conditions.\n(8) Community assistance under the stabilisation and association process to the western Balkan countries will be provided by the relevant financial instruments, and in particular by Council Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 of 5 December 2000 on assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia(2); accordingly, this Regulation will have no financial implications.\n(9) The programming of the financial resources making up Community assistance should be based on the priorities of the European partnerships and decided in accordance with the procedures set out in the relevant financial instruments.\n(10) Revisions of the European partnerships priorities may have a significant political impact on relations with the western Balkan countries. It is therefore appropriate for the Council to adopt the principles, priorities and conditions applicable to each European partnership.\n(11) The follow-up of these European partnerships is ensured within the framework of the mechanisms established under the stabilisation and association process, notably the annual reports on the stabilisation and association process,", "main_body": ["European partnerships shall be established to cover Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro including Kosovo as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, (hereinafter referred to as \"the Partners\").
