This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of barley held by the Swedish intervention agency available on the internal market, which had earlier been destined for export under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2177/2002(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 937/2003(6), and to repeal that Regulation.\n(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender; in addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(6) When the Swedish intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not issued an opinion by the time limit laid down by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["1.
