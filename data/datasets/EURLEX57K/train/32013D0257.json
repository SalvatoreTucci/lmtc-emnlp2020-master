For the purposes set out in this Agreement and for a period starting on 1 January 2014, the overall amount of financial assistance available to the ACP States within this multiannual financial framework shall be EUR 31\u00a0589\u00a0million, as specified in points 2 and 3.\n2. The sum of EUR 29\u00a0089\u00a0million under the 11th European Development Fund (EDF), shall be made available from the date of entry into force of the multiannual financial framework. It shall be allocated between the cooperation instruments as follows:\n(a) EUR 24\u00a0365\u00a0million to finance national and regional indicative programmes. This allocation will be used to finance:\n(i) the national indicative programmes of individual ACP States;\n(ii) the regional indicative programmes of support for regional and inter-regional cooperation and integration of Groups of ACP States;\n(b) EUR 3\u00a0590\u00a0million to finance intra-ACP and inter-regional cooperation with many or all of the ACP States. This envelope may include structural support to institutions and bodies created under this Agreement. It shall also cover assistance with the operating expenditure of the ACP Secretariat referred to in points 1 and 2 of Protocol No 1 on the operating expenditure of the joint institutions;\n(c) EUR 1\u00a0134\u00a0million to finance the Investment Facility in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in Annex II (Terms and conditions of financing) to this Agreement, comprising an additional contribution to EUR 500\u00a0million to the resources of the Investment Facility, managed as a revolving fund, and EUR 634\u00a0million under the form of grants for the financing of the interest rate subsidies and project-related technical assistance provided for in Articles 1, 2 and 4 of that Annex over the period of the 11th EDF.\n3. The operations financed under the Investment Facility, including the corresponding interest rate subsidies, shall be managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB). An amount of up to EUR 2\u00a0500\u00a0million in addition to the funds available from the 11th EDF shall be made available by the EIB in the form of loans from own resources. These resources shall be granted for the purposes set out in Annex II to this Agreement, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the statutes of the EIB and the relevant provisions of the terms and conditions for investment financing in that Annex. All other financial resources under this multiannual financial framework shall be administered by the Commission.\n4. After 31 December 2013 or after the date of entry into force of this multiannual financial framework, whichever is the later, balances from the 10th EDF or from previous EDFs and funds decommitted from projects under these EDFs shall no longer be committed, unless the Council of the European Union decides otherwise by unanimity, with the exception of the remaining balances and reimbursements of the amounts allocated for the financing of the Investment Facility, excluding the related interest rate subsidies, and the remaining balances of the primary agricultural export receipt stabilisation guarantee system (Stabex) under the EDFs prior to the 9th EDF.\n5. The overall amount of this multiannual financial framework shall cover the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. The funds of the 11th EDF, and, in the case of the Investment Facility, the funds stemming from reflows, shall no longer be committed beyond 31 December 2020, unless the Council of the European Union decides otherwise by unanimity, on a proposal from the Commission. However, the funds subscribed by Member States under the 9th, 10th and 11th EDF to finance the Investment Facilities shall remain available after 31 December 2020 for disbursement.\n6. The Committee of Ambassadors, acting on behalf of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers, may, within the overall amount of the multiannual financial framework, take appropriate measures in order to meet programming requirements under one of the allocations provided for in point 2, including the reassignment of funds between these allocations.\n7. The Parties may decide to conduct a performance review, assessing the degree of realisation of commitments and disbursements, as well as the results and impact of the aid provided. This review would be undertaken on the basis of a proposal prepared by the Commission.\n8. Any Member State may provide the Commission or the EIB with voluntary contributions to support the objectives of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement. Member States may also co-finance projects or programmes, for example in the framework of specific initiatives to be managed by the Commission or the EIB. ACP ownership of such initiatives at the national level must be guaranteed.\u2019"}
