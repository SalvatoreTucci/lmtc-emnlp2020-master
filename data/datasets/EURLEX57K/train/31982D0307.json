This results in outgoings on removals, transport, etc.;\nWhereas the Government of the United Kingdom is to contribute \u00a3 6 700 000 towards such costs borne by the NCB in 1981/82;\nWhereas the purpose and form of the aid show that it meets the criteria set out in Article 8 of the Decision;\nWhereas the \u00a3 13 500 000 aid to cover the costs of stocks of coal and coke is based on total producers' stocks and additional stock held by consumers financed directly or indirectly by the producers, amounting to some 30 million tonnes; whereas, with monthly production of around 10 million tonnes, stocks eligible for aid under Article 9 (2) of the Decision amount to 20 million tonnes; whereas the amount of aid per tonne is accordingy \u00a3 0;7; whereas the actual cost of stocks (including depreciation and interest) is substantially higher than the amount of aid;\nWhereas the purpose and form of the aid show that it meets the criteria set out in Article 9 of the Decision;\nWhereas the \u00a3 13 500 000 aid for power-station coal is intended to cover the cost of deliveries of power-station coal to Scotland. From the information provided by the Government of the United Kingdom, the amount and purposes of the aid granted can be regarded as being compatible with Article 11 of the Decision;\nWhereas the aid given to cover losses on mining (\u00a3 423 000 000) will almost completely cover the losses sustained by NCB pits in 1981/82. The aid is given to avoid serious economic and social problems in those coalfields where there are not yet adequate re-employment opportunities and to maintain existing production capacities so as to safeguard energy supplies. The aid is therefore compatible with Article 12 of the Decision;\nII\nWhereas, under Article 3 (2) of the Decision, an examination of the compatibility of the abovementioned aids with the proper functioning of the common market must also extend to all other financial measures to support current production in the 1981/82 financial year;\nWhereas aids for current production in the United Kingdom will amount to 845 700 000 ECU, or 6;77\nECU per tonne for the 1981/82 financial year; whereas the British coal industry therefore receives the lowest subsidy of all coal-producing Member States;\nWhereas an examination of the compatibility of these aids with the proper functioning of the common market requires no detailed information or investigations:\n- there were no supply difficulties on the British market in 1981/82,\n- British coal exports to other Community countries rose in 1981/82 compared with 1980/81,\n- the closure of three unprofitable pits resulted in rationalization and concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest,\n- industrial consumers of coal did not receive indirect aids in 1981/82 as a result of the prices of British coking coal and steam coal;\nWhereas it can therefore be stated that the aids for the British coal industry for current production in the 1981/82 financial year are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;\nWhereas this also applies when account is taken of aids to the coal industry pursuant to Decision 73/287/ECSC;\nIII\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ascertain that aids authorized are used exclusively for the purposes set out in Article 7 to 12 thereof; whereas the Commission must be informed, in particular, of the amount of these aids and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The United Kingdom is hereby authorized in respect of the 1981/82 financial year to grant aids totalling \u00a3 456 700 000 to the British coal-mining industry.\nThe said aids are made up as follows:\n1. Grant to cover the cost incurred by the National Coal Board in respect of relocation of personnel under the production rationalization programme, not exceeding \u00a3 6 700 000;\n2. Aid towards stocking costs in respect of coal and coke, not exceeding \u00a3 13 500 000;\n3. Aid for deliveries of power-station coal to Scotland, not exceeding \u00a3 13 500 000;\n4.
