Moreover, it has been noted that the import prices provided by the Member States under this Regulation do not represent any additional added value, while they require a considerable effort and cost for the different administrations involved in the data collection and reporting. Therefore, the obligation for Member States to notify these prices should be abolished.\n(3) For reasons of clarity and legal certainty it is therefore necessary to repeal the abovementioned Regulations.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal and the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["Regulations (EEC) No 2182/77, (EEC) No 2173/79, (EEC) No 2326/79, (EEC) No 2539/84, (EEC) No 2824/85, (EEC) No 3882/90, (EC) No 2271/95, (EC) No 773/96, (EC) No 793/97, (EC) No 1495/97, (EC) No 23/2001, (EC) No 252/2002 and (EC) No 496/2003 are repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 21.
