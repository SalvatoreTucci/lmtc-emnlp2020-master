The assessment indicates that restructuring aid is necessary to return certain companies in the Czech steel industry to viability. The assessment confirms that implementation of the restructuring programme and plans will lead to the viability of the companies under normal market conditions by the end of the restructuring period; that the amount and intensity of aid are strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary to reach this objective and that restructuring aid to the Czech steel industry will cease by the end of 2003; and that the restructuring programme is linked to a global rationalisation and reduction of overall production capacity in the Czech Republic. The assessment therefore concludes that the restructuring programme and plans submitted by the Czech Republic meet the requirements of Article 8(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement.\n(12) The conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement are accordingly met,", "main_body": ["The restructuring programme and business plans submitted to the Commission by the Czech Republic pursuant to Article 2 of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Czech Republic, of the other part, with regard to an extension of the period laid down in Article 8(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement, are in compliance with the requirements of Article 8(4) of Protocol 2."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 December 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP.
