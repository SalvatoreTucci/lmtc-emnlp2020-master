In particular it sets deadlines for the determination of the surplus sugar quantities, for their elimination and for the proofs of elimination to be provided for by identified operators and/or Bulgaria and Romania. It also fixes reference periods to be used in the calculation of charges for Bulgaria and Romania if surplus quantities are not eliminated.\n(2) Due to delays in obtaining the necessary information on the surplus quantities in Bulgaria and Romania, as well as the time required for thorough analysis of that information and discussion with the Member States concerned, it has not been possible for the Commission to determine the surplus quantities of sugar by 31 July 2007, as set out for by Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1832/2006.\n(3) In order to ensure that Section 2 of Chapter II may be properly applied, the deadlines need to be prolonged.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1832/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1832/2006 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 9(1), \u201831 July 2007\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2008\u2019;\n2.
