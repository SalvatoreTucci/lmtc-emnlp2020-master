Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the growth promoter \u2018Formi LHS (potassium diformate)\u2019 was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1334/2001\u00a0(3). The person responsible for putting into circulation \u2018Formi LHS (potassium diformate)\u2019 submitted an application to obtain a definitive authorisation for 10 years. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised for 10 years.\n(6) The use of the additive \u2018clinoptilolite of sedimentary origin\u2019 as a member of the group of binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for pigs, chickens and turkeys for fattening and for bovines and salmon by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1887/2000\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time-limit of that additive. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that additive, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(7) The use of the additive \u2018sodium ferrocyanide\u2019 as a member of the group of binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for all species or categories of animals by Commission Regulation (EC) No 256/2002\u00a0(5). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time-limit of that additive. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that additive, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(8) The use of the additive \u2018potassium ferrocyanide\u2019 as a member of the group of binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for all species or categories of animals by Regulation (EC) No 256/2002. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time-limit of that additive. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that additive, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(9) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10 W) was provisionally authorised for the first time for laying hens, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 418/2001\u00a0(6). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(10) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Enterococcus faecium (NCIMB 11181) was authorised without a time-limit for calves and for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1333/2004\u00a0(7). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of that micro-organism preparation to chickens for fattening. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) delivered a favourable opinion on 13 April 2005 on the safety of that additive when used in the animal category chickens for fattening, under the conditions of use set out in Annex IV to this Regulation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation as specified in Annex IV, should be provisionally authorised for four years.\n(11) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Enterococcus faecium (CECT 4515) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for piglets and for calves by Commission Regulation (EC) No 654/2000\u00a0(8). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of that micro-organism preparation to chickens for fattening. The EFSA delivered a favourable opinion on 13 April 2005 on the safety of that additive when used in the animal category chickens for fattening, under the conditions of use set out in Annex IV to this Regulation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation as specified in Annex IV, should be provisionally authorised for four years.\n(12) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(9).\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Growth promoters\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised for 10 years for use as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The additives belonging to the group \u2018Binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants\u2019, as specified in Annex II, are authorised without a time limit for use as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex III, are authorised for use without a time-limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019, as specified in Annex IV, are authorised provisionally for four years as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 November 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
