The results of the farm structure surveys, classified by European size units and type of farming serve as a basis for selecting and weighting the FADN farm sample.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2237/77 of 23 September 1977 on the form of farm return to be used for the purpose of determining incomes of agricultural holdings(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) 1837/2001(6), lays down the type of accountancy data to be given in the farm return.\n(3) Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 on the organisation of Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings(7), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 143/2002(8), lists the characteristics to be surveyed in a series of surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings.\n(4) The structure and content of both the farm return and the list of survey characteristics for the 2003, 2005 and 2007 surveys have been recently amended by those Regulations.\n(5) Decision 85/377/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 85/377/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 May 2003.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 109, 23.6.1965, p. 1859/65.\n(2) OJ L 174, 2.7.1997, p. 7.\n(3) OJ L 220, 17.8.1985, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 291, 13.11.1999, p. 28.\n(5) OJ L 263, 17.10.1977, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 255, 24.9.2001, p. 1.\n(7) OJ L 56, 2.3.1998, p. 1.\n(8) OJ L 24, 26.1.2002, p. 16.\nANNEX\nDecision 85/377/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
