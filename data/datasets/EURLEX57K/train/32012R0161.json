Imposition of the catch composition rules will result in further increases in discarding of this stock to meet landing requirements before they contribute to future production. The removal of spawning biomass for a stock below safe biological limits represents a serious threat to the long-term recovery and sustainability of the stock. Landings not catches are controlled by the continued application of the catch composition rules. Regardless of any quota change the current increasing abundance of the haddock stock will result in increasing levels of regulatory induced discarding.\n(8) An increase of fishing pressure will result from increased fishing opportunities for the stock of haddock in ICES division VIa as of February 2012. Any effort to utilise the 2012 fishing opportunities will result in an increased mortality upon any stock caught along with haddock, particularly for whiting and cod.\n(9) As the main fishery for haddock occurs from February onwards, there is a need to introduce changes to prevent excessive discarding immediately.\n(10) A continuation and increase of discards of the haddock stock will impact future recovery and production. Maximising fishing opportunities threatens the sustainability of other stocks. There is a danger of causing further crashes of these stocks as a result of high fishing mortality.\n(11) The mismatch between landing requirements and unavoidable catches of haddock will increase substantially in 2012. It is therefore necessary to immediately suspend the catch composition rules as regards haddock to prevent a serious threat to the recovery of that species in waters to the west of Scotland and prevent additional fishing pressure on other stocks, while allowing for the rational use of 2012 fishing opportunities,", "main_body": ["During the period of application of this Regulation, the catch composition percentages set out in points 6.5(iii) and 6.6(ii) of Part A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 shall not apply as regards haddock.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply until 25 August 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 February 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 22, 26.1.2009, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 24.12.2009, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 165, 24.6.2011, p. 1."}
