These quantities will increase at the start of each marketing year by 40000 and 250 tonnes respectively relative to the quantities laid down for the preceding year.\n(2) To ensure that imports of the cereal products covered by these tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences will be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties after a period of reflection and subject, where appropriate, to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.\n(3) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines for lodging licence applications should be laid down and, notwithstanding Articles 8 and 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(4), the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.\n(4) To take account of delivery conditions, the import licences should be valid from the day of their issue until the end of the month following that in which they are issued.\n(5) To ensure efficient management of the quota, the import licences should not be transferable and the import licence security should be fixed at a relatively high level, notwithstanding Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2110/2000(6).\n(6) For the same reasons rapid two-way communication must be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.\n(7) In accordance with the instructions laid down in Annex A(b) to Regulation (EC) No 1727/2000, wheat imported under this quota must be of medium or high quality as destined in Regulation (EC) No 1249/96.
