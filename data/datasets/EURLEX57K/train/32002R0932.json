Supplementary aid is granted in one or more producer regions where the average income from production is significantly lower than the average for the Community.\n(3) Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93 fixes the flat-rate reference income at EUR 64,03 per 100 kilograms net weight of green bananas ex-packing shed.\n(4) In 2001, the average production income, calculated on the basis of the average of the prices for bananas marketed outside the producer regions at the stage of delivery at first port of unloading (goods not unloaded) on the one hand and the selling prices on local markets for bananas marketed in their producer region on the other, less the flat-rate amounts laid down in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93, was less than the flat-rate reference income fixed for 2001. The compensatory aid to be granted in respect of 2001 should be fixed accordingly.\n(5) The unit amount of advances and of the relevant security depend on the aid fixed for the preceding year pursuant to Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93.\n(6) The annual average production income from the marketing of bananas produced in Portugal has proved to be significantly lower than the Community average during 2001. As a result, supplementary aid should be granted in the producer regions in Portugal under Article 12(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, in accordance with the practice followed in recent years. As regards the regions in Portugal, and Madeira in particular, the data for 2001 reveal extremely difficult production and marketing conditions, requiring supplementary aid to be fixed at a level covering 75 % of the difference between the average income in the Community and the average recorded on selling products in those regions.\n(7) Given that not all the necessary data were available, it has not hitherto been possible to determine the compensatory aid for 2001. Provision should be made for the balance of the aid for 2001 and of the advances for bananas marketed during January and February 2002 to be paid within two months of the publication of this Regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["1.
