The implementation of the tariff quota gave rise to a number of practical difficulties.\n(2) In the first week of bidding for imports under subquota III, which covers all third countries except the United States of America and Canada, there was substantial oversubscription, leading to the exhaustion of the subquotas until the subsequent quarter, due to open on 1 April 2003. It is important to take measures to reduce oversubscription, namely by harmonising the dates of application in all Member States in national holidays, and by reducing the period of validity of import licences.\n(3) The provisions relating to certificates of origin, namely the ones concerning administrative cooperation with exporting authorities, have proven to be difficult to apply taking into account the potential number of exporting countries concerned. These provisions have to be amended retroactively, in order to avoid discrimination between operators.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 is amended as follows:\n1. In Article 5(2), the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:\"No later than 18.00 hours Brussels time on the day of lodging of licence applications, the competent authorities shall forward to the Commission by fax a notification in accordance with the model annexed hereto, and the total quantity resulting from the sum of all quantities indicated on the import licence applications.\"\n2.
