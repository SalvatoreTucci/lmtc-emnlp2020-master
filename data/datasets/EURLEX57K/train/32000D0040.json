The applicant and/or his supplier or suppliers, as appropriate, shall indicate to the competent body assessing the application which refrigerants and foaming agents have been used and details of their ozone depletion potential.\n3. Reduction of global warming potential (GWP) of refrigerants and foaming agents\nThe refrigerants in the refrigerating circuit and foaming agent used for the insulation of the appliance, shall have a global warming potential equal to, or lower than, 15 (rated as CO2 equivalents over a period of 100 years).\nThe applicant shall declare compliance of the product with these requirements. The applicant and/or his supplier or suppliers, as appropriate, shall indicate to the competent body assessing the application which refrigerants and foaming agents have been used and details of their global warming potential.\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA\n4. Life-time extension\nThe manufacturer shall offer a commercial guarantee to ensure that the appliance will function for at least three years. This guarantee shall be valid from the date of delivery to the customer.\nThe availability of compatible replacement parts and service shall be guaranteed for 12 years from the time that production ceases.\nThe applicant shall declare compliance of the product with these requirements.\n5. Take-back and recycling\nThe manufacturer shall offer, free of charge, the take-back for recycling of the refrigerator and of components being replaced, except for items contaminated by users (e.g. refrigerators originating from medical or nuclear establishments).\nIn addition, the refrigerator shall meet the following criteria:\n1. The manufacturer shall take into account the disassembly of the refrigerator and provide a dissassembly report. Amongst others, the report shall confirm that:\n- joints are easy to find and accessible\n- electronic assemblies are easy to find and to dismantle\n- the product is easy to dismantle by using commonly available tools\n- incompatible and hazardous materials are separable.\n2. Plastic parts heavier than 50 grams shall have a permanent marking identifying the material, in conformity with ISO 11469. Excluded from this criterion are extruded palstic parts.\n3.
