The ICCAT Convention established an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) which adopts conservation and management measures. Those measures become binding on the contracting parties.\n(3) In 1998, ICCAT adopted resolution 98-18 concerning the unreported and unregulated catches of tuna by large-scale long line vessels in the Convention area. That resolution established procedures for identifying countries whose vessels had fished for tuna and tuna-like species in a manner which diminished the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures. It also specified measures to be taken, including if necessary non-discriminatory trade restrictive measures, in order to prevent those countries\u2019 vessels from continuing such fishing practices.\n(4) Following the adoption of resolution 98-18, ICCAT has identified Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures. ICCAT has substantiated its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the activities of vessels.\n(5) As a consequence, ICCAT recommended that contracting parties take appropriate measures, consistent with the provisions of its resolution 98-18, to prohibit imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products in any form from those countries.\n(6) In 2004, imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna originating in Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone into the Union were prohibited by Council Regulation (EC) No 827/2004\u00a0(3).\n(7) At its 14th special meeting in 2004, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made by Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to address its concerns and adopted recommendations lifting trade-restrictive measures against those three countries in relation to Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products.\n(8) As a consequence, Council Regulation (EC) No 919/2005\u00a0(4) amended Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 to lift the prohibition on imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products from Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone into the Union. Following that amendment, Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 only prohibits such imports from Bolivia and Georgia.\n(9) At its 22nd regular annual meeting in 2011, ICCAT acknowledged the actions taken by Bolivia and Georgia and adopted recommendation 11-19 lifting the prohibition on imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products that continued to apply to those two countries.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 should therefore be repealed,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 26 February 2014.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
