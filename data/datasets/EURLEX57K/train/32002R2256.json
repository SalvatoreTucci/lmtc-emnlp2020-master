Following that decision an imbalance in the fishing possibilities in favour of the Community has occurred, which should be corrected by the Community reducing its fishing possibilities for redfish and flatfish in zone Vb (Faroese waters).\n(4) Cod and haddock should be covered by the by-catch provisions for Norway lobster in the Skagerrak and in the Kattegat.\n(5) The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) adopted, at its annual meeting in June 2002, catch limitations for yellowfin tuna; although the Community is not a member of this organisation, it is necessary to implement those catch limitations to ensure sustainable management of this fish resource.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001(2) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) In order to ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to apply these provisions before 31 December 2002.
