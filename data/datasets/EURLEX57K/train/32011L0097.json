There is progress in the development of environmentally sound solidification options but it is premature to decide on the large-scale viability of such options.\n(10) Additional assessments of the long-term behaviour of metallic mercury in underground storage are needed for the determination of sound and knowledge-based requirements for permanent storage. The requirements laid down in this Directive should therefore be limited to temporary storage and are considered as appropriate and representing the best available techniques for the safe storage of metallic mercury for a time span of up to 5 years.\n(11) Directive 1999/31/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) No opinion was given by the committee referred to in Article 16 of Directive 1999/31/EC. It is therefore appropriate for the Council to", "main_body": ["HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:", "Annexes I, II and III to Directive 1999/31/EC are hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 March 2013.
