VASSEUR\n(1) OJ No 121, 29. 7. 1964, p.  2012/64. Directive as last amended by Decision 95/1/EC, Euratom, ECSC (OJ No L 1, 1. 1. 1995, p.  1).\nANNEX\nSECTION A SAMPLING METHOD\n1. Carcases, half-carcases and quarters obtained from  the slaughterhouse of origin ('swab technique')\nSamples using the surface swabbing method are taken  at sites likely to be contaminated. Surface swabbing includes opening sides of the carcases and cut  surfaces. In addition beef carcases are swabbed in at least three areas (leg, flank and neck), pork  carcases however are swabbed in at least two areas (leg and brisket).\nTo avoid cross-contamination, samples are taken without handling the meat and by using sterile  swabs and templates.\nThe sampling areas (20 cm \u00d7 20 cm) described in the first paragraph are swabbed with two sterile  cotton swabs. The first swab is moistened with sterile peptone water and is rubbed firmly several  times across the sampling area. The same sampling area is rubbed with the second swab used dry.  Subsequently swabs are put into 100 ml of buffered peptone water.\nEach sample is duly marked and identified.\n2. Quarter cuts obtained from an establishment other than the slaughterhouse of origin of the  carcase, cuts and smaller pieces ('destructive method')\nPieces of tissue are obtained by punching a  sterile cork borer into the meat surface or cutting a slice of tissue of approximately 25 cm\u00b2 with  sterile instruments. The samples are aseptically transferred into a sample container or plastic  dilution bag and then homogenized (peristaltic stomacher or rotary blender (homogenizer)). Samples  of frozen meat remain frozen during transport to the laboratory. Samples from chilled meat are not  frozen but kept refrigerated. Separate samples of the same consignment may be pooled.\nEach sample is duly marked and identified.\nSECTION B NUMBER OF SAMPLES TO BE TAKEN\n1. Carcases, half-carcases, half-carcases cut into a  maximum of three pieces and quarters referred to under A (1)\nThe number of carcases or  half-carcases (units) in a consigment of which separate random samples are to be taken is a  follows:\n>TABLE>\n2. Quarters, cuts and smaller pieces as referred to under A (2)\nThe number of  packing units in the consignment of which separate random samples are to be taken is as follows:\n>TABLE>\nDepending on the weight of the packing units, the number of packing units to be  sampled can be reduced using the following multiplication factors:\n>TABLE>\nSECTION C MICROBIOLOGICAL METHOD FOR THE EXAMINATION OF THE SAMPLES\nMicrobiological testing of the samples for salmonella must be carried out according to the  standard method of the International Organization for Standardization ISO 6579:1993. However,  methods offering equivalent guarantees may be authorized on a case-by-case basis by the Council,  acting on a proposal from the Commission."}
