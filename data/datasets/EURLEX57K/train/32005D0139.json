As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law are the basis of our relations.\nBy letter of 19 February 2002, the European Union informed you of its decision to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and to take certain \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of that Agreement.\nBy letters of 19 February 2003 and 19 February 2004, the European Union informed you of its decisions not to revoke the application of the \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 and to extend the period of application of such measures until 20 February 2004 and 20 February 2005 respectively.\nToday, at the end of a new 12-month period, the European Union considers that democratic principles are still not upheld in Zimbabwe and that no significant progress has been achieved by your country\u2019s Government in the five fields cited in the Council Decision of 18 February 2002 (end of politically motivated violence, free and fair elections, freedom of the media, independence of the judiciary and end of illegal occupations of farms).\nBearing in mind the above, the European Union considers that there is no question of the appropriate measures being revoked and it has decided to extend the period of their application until 20 February 2006. These measures will be reviewed on the basis of an in-depth assessment of the situation in the light of the parliamentary election scheduled to take place in Zimbabwe in March 2005.\nThe European Union would like to emphasise that it attaches paramount importance to the holding of free and fair parliamentary elections and, to this effect, it hopes that you and your Government will do everything you can to ensure that the political and electoral environment is conducive to the holding of free and fair parliamentary elections. This would enable a dialogue to be conducted on the basis of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, which could lead to the lifting of the suspension of the signing of the 9th EDF National Indicative Programme for Zimbabwe thereby making possible the resumption of full cooperation instruments in the near future.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council"}
