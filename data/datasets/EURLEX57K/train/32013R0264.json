Once they have been dehydrated, the bulbs are either \u2018topped\u2019, in other words separated from the parts visible above ground, or used to produce braids, in which case the above-ground part is left intact. The minimum number of onions required to form a braid is six, regardless of their size. These onions are packaged in bags or crates, whose weight can vary up to a maximum of 25\u00a0kg.\nPackaging must take place in the production area and must comply with traditional methods, which are deep-rooted in tradition and local historical folklore, so as to ensure that the product can be traced and checked and to maintain product quality.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe packages must display, in printed characters twice as large as for other indications, the terms PGI \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019, whilst specifying the type of onion \u2014 \u2018cipollotto\u2019, \u2018cipolla da consumo fresco\u2019, \u2018cipolla da serbo\u2019 \u2014 and the brand.\nWhen released for consumption, adhesive (or any other type of) labels are placed on young onions and on storage onions, displaying the EU logo and the product\u2019s brand. On the other hand, a detailed label must be placed on each bunch of fresh onions packed in crates, whatever the size of the latter, displaying the company\u2019s business name, the EU logo, the brand and the type of product so as to guarantee its traceability and to make it perfectly recognisable.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe production area of PGI \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 is made up of land which is well-suited to their cultivation, covering part or all of the administrative territory of the following Calabrian municipalities:\n(a) province of Cosenza:\n(b) province of Catanzaro:\n(c) province of Vibo Valentia:\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\n\u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 is cultivated on sandy or partly sandy land of average composition containing open clay or silt-laden soils, located along the coastal line or running alongside rivers and streams. Despite their gravelly texture, these soils of alluvial origin do not constrict the development and growth of the bulbs. Coastal land is well-suited for growing early-maturing onions to be consumed fresh, whereas internal land, made of clay or open clay soils, are well-suited for growing storage onions. Red onions have long been, and continue to be, grown both in family vegetable gardens and across large-scale areas and are an integral part of the rural countryside, of people\u2019s diets, local dishes and traditional recipes.\nThe soil and climatic features of the territory combine to make a product which is quite unique, of high-level quality and renowned throughout the world.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 is known for its quality and organoleptic features such as the tenderness of its bulbs, its sweetness and easy digestibility. These features also enable one to eat \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 raw, and undoubtedly in far greater quantities than for normal onions.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe request to have the PGI \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 recognised is justified by the product\u2019s reputation and renown which notably grew thanks to various promotion campaigns, as demonstrated by historical and bibliographical sources. Various historical and bibliographical sources suggest that the onion was first introduced into the Mediterranean basin and in Calabria by the Phoenicians, then by the Greeks. The onion, very much appreciated during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, was considered a key product in people\u2019s diets and for the local economy; onions were either bartered directly or sold and exported by sea to Tunisia, Algeria and Greece. Several travellers who visited Calabria and the Tyrrhenian coast between 1700 and 1800 refer to common \u2018Cipolle Rosse\u2019 (red onions) in their writings. Onions have always been a part of farmers\u2019 diets and of local production. Already in 1905, during a trip to Calabria during which he visited Tropea, Doctor Albert was struck by the poverty of the peasants who only ate onions. At the turn of the twentieth century, the cultivation of the Tropea onion moved away from small gardens and family vegetable gardens and started to be grown on a very large scale. In 1929, the construction of the Valle Ruffa aqueduct enabled onion crops to be irrigated, which improved both the yield and the quality of the product. It was during the Bourbon period that the greatest impulse was given to spreading onion cultivation towards northern European markets. The onion soon became a sought-after and much appreciated product, as demonstrated by the \u2018Studi sulla Calabria\u2019 (Studies on Calabria) of 1901, which also refer to the shape of the bulb and to the red, oblong onions from Calabria. The first statistics compiled on onion cultivation in Calabria can be found in the \u2018Enciclopedia agraria Reda (1936-39)\u2019 (Reda Agricultural Encyclopaedia). The unique commercial features of this onion, which ensured its renown nationally, and also, above all, its historical and cultural value in the geographical area in question (still very much present in current cultural practices such as cooking, folkloric demonstrations and everyday idiomatic expressions) explain why this product has often been imitated and why its name is subject to counterfeiting.\nReference to publication of the specification\nThe competent Ministry launched the national objection procedure by publishing a proposal for recognising the PGI \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 in Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No 185 of 10 August 2011.\nThe full text of the product specification is available on the following website:\nhttp://www.politicheagricole.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/3335\nor alternatively:\nby going direct to the home page of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy (http://www.politicheagricole.it) and clicking on \u2018Qualit\u00e0 e sicurezza\u2019 (\u2018Quality and security\u2019, on the top right of the screen) and then on \u2018Disciplinari di Produzione all\u2019esame dell\u2019UE\u2019 (Specifications subject to examination by the EU).\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs."}
