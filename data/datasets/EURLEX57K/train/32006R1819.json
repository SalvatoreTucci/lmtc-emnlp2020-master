In line with UN Security Council Resolutions 1647 (2005), 1683 (2006) and 1689 (2006), Common Positions 2006/31/CFSP and 2006/518/CFSP confirmed the restrictive measures of Common Position 2004/137/CFSP for a further period of time and provided for certain modifications.\n(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 234/2004\u00a0(4) prohibits the provision to Liberia of technical and financial assistance related to military activities, the import of rough diamonds from Liberia and the import of round logs and timber products originating in that country.\n(3) On 20 June 2006, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1689 (2006). It decided, inter alia, not to renew the prohibition against imports of all round logs and timber products originating in Liberia, which had been imposed by paragraph 10 of UNSCR 1521 (2003) and, after several extensions, expired on 20 June 2006. The Security Council expressed its determination to reinstate that prohibition if, within a period of ninety days, Liberia failed to pass the forestry legislation proposed by the Forest Reform Monitoring Committee created by the Government of Liberia.\n(4) The Security Council revisited the matter on 20 October 2006 and concluded that Liberia had adopted the necessary forestry legislation. It resolved therefore not to reinstate the prohibition.\n(5) Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 234/2004, which prohibits the import into the Community of all round logs and timber products originating in Liberia and was suspended from 23 June 2006 to 18 September 2006, should therefore be repealed with retroactive effect to 19 September 2006,", "main_body": ["In Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 234/2004, paragraph 2 shall be deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 19 September 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 December 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
