\u2018central hub\u2019 architecture (client-server with an intelligent router) and a \u2018peer to peer\u2019 architecture. Member States can choose to use any of the above two architectures to exchange XML messages on sTESTA network (using HTTPS).\nThe ERRU system is depicted in figure 1 below:\nFigure 1\nERRU system\nMember States shall have two options to communicate messages, depending on the architecture which is being used by the Member States involved in the exchange: Using central hub architecture or using peer-to-peer architecture.\nThe central hub shall be managed by the Commission.

Only logging data shall be stored on this central hub. The Commission shall have no access to business data except for maintenance and debugging purposes.\nMember States shall be responsible for their national system. Member States using a peer-to-peer architecture shall be responsible for the interoperability of the peer-to-peer architecture with the central hub.\nMember States shall use for the interconnection through ERRU:\n\u2014 Standard Internet protocols (XML, HTTPS, XML Web Services), and\n\u2014 sTESTA private network of the European Commission.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STATISTICS AND LOGGING\nMember States using peer-to-peer connections shall place at the disposal of the Commission the information necessary for statistical purposes on a weekly basis.\nIn order to ensure privacy, the data for statistical purposes shall be anonymous.\nLogging information shall keep track of all transactions for monitoring and debugging purposes, and to be able to generate statistics about these transactions.
