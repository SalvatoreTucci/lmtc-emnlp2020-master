That list includes disodium octaborate tetrahydrate.\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, disodium octaborate tetrahydrate has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.\n(3) The Netherlands was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 7 July 2006 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 20 February 2009, in an assessment report.\n(5) It appears from the examinations made that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing disodium octaborate tetrahydrate may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include disodium octaborate tetrahydrate in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing disodium octaborate tetrahydrate can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(6) However, unacceptable risks were identified for the in situ treatment of wood outdoors and for treated wood exposed to weathering. Therefore, authorisations for these uses should not be granted unless data have been submitted in order to demonstrate that the products can be used without unacceptable risks to the environment.\n(7) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at the Community level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those risks to the compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Community level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to mitigate the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n(8) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that specific risk mitigation measures are applied at product authorisation level to products containing disodium octaborate tetrahydrate. In particular, appropriate measures should be taken to protect the soil and aquatic compartments since unacceptable risks to these compartments have been identified during the evaluation. Products should also be used with appropriate protective equipment if the risk identified for professional and industrial users cannot be reduced by other means.\n(9) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance disodium octaborate tetrahydrate and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing disodium octaborate tetrahydrate to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.\n(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 August 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 September 2011.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.

In particular, labels and/or safety-data sheets of products authorised for industrial use shall indicate that freshly treated timber must be stored after treatment under shelter and/or on impermeable hard standing to prevent direct losses to soil or water and that any losses must be collected for reuse or disposal.\u2019\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0For the implementation of the common principles of Annex VI, the content and conclusions of assessment reports are available on the Commission website: http://ec.europa.eu/comm/environment/biocides/index.htm"}
