Under Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999, areas set aside must so remain for a period commencing on 15 January at the latest and ending on 31 August at the earliest and, except as otherwise provided for, may not be used for agricultural production or for any lucrative purpose.\n(2) In recent months certain regions of the Community have experienced extreme drought, which has seriously affected supplies of fodder and exposed breeders to severe losses of income because they have been obliged to sell their stock if normal feed is not ensured.\n(3) It is therefore desirable to locate extra local fodder supplies for animal feed prior to the autumn.\n(4) A derogation from Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 should therefore be granted to authorise the use, in the regions concerned, of land set aside for arable crops for cattle fodder before expiry of the set-aside period, while providing for measures to ensure compliance with the non-lucrative nature of the use of such land.\n(5) The measures in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
