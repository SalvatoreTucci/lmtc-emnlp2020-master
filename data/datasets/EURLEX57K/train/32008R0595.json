Those products should be considered as withdrawn from the list and should as a consequence be inserted in it as new products.\n(4) Experience has shown the need to provide for an expiry date for the suspensions listed in Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 to ensure that account is taken of technological and economic changes. That should not exclude the premature termination of certain measures or their continuation beyond that period, if economic reasons are submitted, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Commission Communication of 1998 concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas\u00a0(2).\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point 1.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.\n(7) Since the suspensions laid down in this Regulation have to take effect from 1 July 2008, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the rows for the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation shall be inserted;\n2. the rows for the products for which the CN and TARIC codes are given in Annex II to this Regulation shall be deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 16 June 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
