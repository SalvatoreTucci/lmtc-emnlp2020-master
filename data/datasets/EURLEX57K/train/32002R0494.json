However, by that date the revision of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 will not have been achieved. An interruption of the application of the measures would cause serious harm to the stock of hake.\n(5) Therefore, immediate action is required to ensure that the measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 continue to apply until the revision of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 is adopted by the Council.\n(6) Fishing with beam trawls of mesh size less than 100 mm within areas otherwise restricted to fishing with other towed gears of mesh size of 100 mm or greater is unlikely to imperil the conservation of the hake stock since such fishing with beam trawls incurs a very low level of hake taken as by-catches. It is necessary, however, to ensure that low by-catch levels are not exceeded and to limit the time period and geographical area in which such fishing may take place.\n(7) Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 provides a derogation which is justified by the fact that the limit on the catches of hake would cause serious economic problems for small fishing vessels working on a daily basis. The derogation has negligible consequences regarding the conservation and recovery of the hake stock. It should therefore be maintained.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["This Regulation shall apply to fishing vessels operating within ICES sub-areas V and VI and ICES divisions VII b, c, f, g, h, j, k and ICES divisions VIII a, b, d, e.", "1.
