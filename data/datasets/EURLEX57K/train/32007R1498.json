Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down, in particular, detailed rules for applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. It limits the validity of licences to the final day of the tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply, without prejudice to the additional rules laid down by this Regulation.\n(4) The rules laid down in the above Regulation should therefore apply to Regulation (EC) No 192/2002. However, certain rules should be adapted to reflect the specific characteristics of the trade covered by Regulation (EC) No 192/2002. In the interests of clarity and rationality, Regulation (EC) No 192/2002 should be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(4) should also apply, subject to the specific measures provided for in this Regulation.\n(6) With a view to ensuring orderly management, preventing speculation and providing for effective controls, detailed rules should be laid down for submitting licence applications and the documents that the interested parties must produce. To this end, the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply.\n(7) The specific features of the licence application form for importing the products in question should be laid down and, in order to ensure that such imports are managed strictly, it should be laid down that the rights deriving from licences are not transferable.\n(8) Rules should also be laid down regarding time limits for the submission of licence applications and the issue of licences by the competent authorities of the Member States,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulations (EC) No 1291/2000 and (EC) No 1301/2006 shall apply to the import at zero-rate customs duty of products falling within CN Chapter 17 and CN codes 1806\u00a010\u00a030 and 1806\u00a010\u00a090 with OCTs origin subject to cumulation with sugar of ACP and/or EC origin, unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licences issued under this Regulation shall bear the serial number 09.4652.", "For the purposes of this Regulation the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and the relevant administrative methods shall be those set out in Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licence applications shall relate to a quantity of not less than 25 tonnes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licence applications shall be accompanied by the following documents:\n(a) the export licence issued by the OCTs authorities in accordance with the model form set out in Annex I, issued by the bodies responsible for issuing EUR 1 certificates;\n(b) proof that the applicant has lodged a security of EUR 12 per 100 kilograms.", "The licence application and import licence shall show:\n(a) in section 7, the OCTs of provenance, the word \u2018yes\u2019 being marked with a cross;\n(b) in section 8, the OCTs of origin, the word \u2018yes\u2019 being marked with a cross;\n(c) in section 20 of the licence, one of the entries listed in Annex II.", "Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 notwithstanding, the rights deriving from import licences shall not be transferable.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, licence applications shall be submitted in the first seven days of January, April, July and October of each year.\nAn applicant may submit only one licence application per month of submission of licence applications.
