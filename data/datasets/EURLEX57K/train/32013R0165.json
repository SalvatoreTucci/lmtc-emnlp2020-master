In view of the current market situation, it is appropriate to grant aid for private storage of butter as from 1 March 2013.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 of 20 August 2008 laying down common rules for the granting of private storage aid for certain agricultural products\u00a0(2) has established common rules for the implementation of a private storage aid scheme.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, aid fixed in advance is to be granted in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provided for in Chapter III of that Regulation.\n(5) In accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 the aid should be fixed in the light of storage costs and the likely trends in prices for fresh butter and butter from stocks.\n(6) It is appropriate to fix aid for the costs for entry and exit of the products concerned and for daily costs for cold storage and financing.\n(7) To facilitate the implementation of the present measure and taking into consideration the existing practice in the Member States, the aid should relate only to products that have been fully placed into storage. Consequently, a derogation from Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 should be provided for.\n(8) For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, where the required information concerning storage details are already included in the application for aid, it is appropriate to waive the request to notify the same information after the conclusion of the contract as provided for in point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008.\n(9) For reasons of simplification and logistic efficiency, Member States should be allowed to waive the requirement to mark the contract number on each unit stored where the contracts number is entered in the stores register.\n(10) For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, taking into account the particular situation for butter storage, the checks provided for in Article 36(6) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 should be carried out in respect of at least one half of the contracts. Consequently, a derogation from that Article should be provided for.\n(11) Commission Regulation (EC) No 792/2009 of 31 August 2009 laying down detailed rules for the Member States\u2019 notification to the Commission of information and documents in implementation of the common organisation of the markets, the direct payments\u2019 regime, the promotion of agricultural products and the regimes applicable to the outermost regions and the smaller Aegean islands\u00a0(3) lays down common rules for notifying information and documents by the competent authorities of the Member States to the Commission.
