Furthermore, in June 2013, Belarus reported the confirmation of an outbreak of ASF in backyard pigs in the region of Grodno, some forty kilometres from the Lithuanian border and close to the border with Poland.\n(3) The ASF situation in countries bordering the European Union constitutes a direct threat to pig holdings within the Union, because the virus may be introduced into Member States bordering the infected third countries through wild boar entering Union territory from infected areas, but also through vehicles which have transported live animals and feed or through the unauthorised introduction into the Union of products derived from animals of the porcine species.\n(4) The risk of ASF introduction into the Union is higher for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland due to the occurrence and the evolution of this diseases in the bordering territory of Belarus and the Russian Federation and they have informed the Commission and the other Member States of the measures that they intended to adopt for the protection of their territories and of other Member States.\n(5) Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland implemented surveillance for the early detection of ASF both in wild boars and domestic pigs and have raised disease awareness and preparedness in the framework of their contingency plans drawn up in accordance with Council Directive 2002/60/EC\u00a0(3) to ensure a rapid response should ASF be introduced. Lithuania is directly threatened by the presence of ASF across the border in Belarus, in order to minimise the risk of disease spread on its territory should ASF be introduced, Lithuania intends to establish a buffer zone of 10 kilometres along the border with Belarus, in which they will decrease the density of susceptible hosts by promoting slaughter of pigs and preventing restocking of pig holdings.\n(6) Wild boars moving through borders between the affected third countries and the EU pose a risk of ASF introduction, especially in some areas with intensive agriculture where the wild boar is attracted by crops. As a short time risk mitigation measure, in an attempt to reduce this risk and based on available preliminary research data on the efficacy of the use of repellents consisting of synthetic odorous substances suggesting quite high efficiency and a relative long lasting period, Lithuania intends to apply these repellents in some areas of its territory close to its eastern border in order to deter wild boars from entering the maize and other crops fields.\n(7) Cleansing and disinfection of vehicles that were possibly in contact with the ASF virus is one of the precautionary measures against the entry of ASF into the Union. Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision 2013/426/EU\u00a0(4) lays down certain measures to prevent the introduction into the Union of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation and establishes that vehicles which have transported live animals and feed and which enter the Union from infected areas are appropriately cleansed and disinfected, and that such cleansing and disinfection is properly documented.\n(8) Notwithstanding the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2009\u00a0(5), the risk of ASF introduction into the Union by personal consignments containing pig products sent by post or carried in the baggage of travellers arriving in particular from Belarus and the Russian Federation, is higher than negligible and requires additional controls at the points of entry.\n(9) In addition, a wide range of stakeholders including veterinarians, professional and non-professional farmers, truck drivers, custom agents, passengers and the general public should be made aware of the risks of ASF introduction and its consequences by means of well-targeted awareness campaigns.\n(10) In the first week of August 2013, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland submitted their respective plans and initial estimates of cost for the implementation of emergency measures in the areas considered at risk of introduction of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation. Financial support for personnel is required to ensure the implementation of the surveillance activities foreseen in the submitted plans. The plans have been examined by the Commission for Union financial contribution and were found to comply with Directive 2002/60/EC.\n(11) The actions undertaken by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in order to directly reduce the risk of disease introduction into the Union, namely cleansing and disinfection of vehicles, should be co-financed at a rate of 100\u00a0%.\n(12) The additional surveillance undertaken by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in the areas at higher risk of disease introduction and the actions undertaken in the framework of the awareness campaign by those Member States should be co-financed at a rate of 50\u00a0%.\n(13) The actions undertaken by Lithuania using repellents in defined high risk areas close to its eastern borders in order to reduce the risk of disease introduction into the Union via wild boar, should be co-financed at a rate of 50\u00a0%. The special actions undertaken by Lithuania to decrease the density of pigs at the border with Belarus should be co-financed at a rate of 30\u00a0%.\n(14) Due to the urgency of the measures, the cost incurred by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland since 2 July 2013, the date of notification of the emergency measures, should be eligible for Union financial contributions.\n(15) Article 8(3) of Decision 2009/470/EC provides that the eligible costs and the level, of the financial contribution from the Union must be set out. However, given the need to prevent excessive expenditure for the Union budget, maximum amounts are to be established which reflect the reasonable payment for certain surveillance activities.\n(16) A reasonable payment is a payment for a material or a service at a proportionate price compared to the market price. Pending on-the-spot checks carried out by the Commission, it is now necessary to approve specific financial contribution from the Union to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\n(17) The payment of the financial contribution shall be subject to the condition that the actions planned have actually been carried out and that the authorities supply all the necessary information to the Commission.\n(18) As the plans submitted by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for emergency measures against the introduction of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation carried out in 2013 are a sufficiently detailed framework in the meaning of Article 94 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012\u00a0(6), the present decision constitutes a financing decision for the expenditure provided for in the work programme for grants.\n(19) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the framework of the emergency measures for the protection against ASF taken by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in 2013, those Member States shall
