From that date, Mayotte ceased to be an overseas country or territory and became an outermost region of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(2) The Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an agreement with the Republic of the Seychelles relating to the access, for fishing vessels flying the flag of the Republic of Seychelles, to waters and marine biological resources of the Union in the exclusive economic zone off the coast of Mayotte.\n(3) As a result of those negotiations, the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union (\u2018Agreement\u2019) was initialled on 15 November 2013.\n(4) In order for the authorities in Mayotte to implement the rules of the common fisheries policy (CFP) from the date on which Mayotte becomes an outermost region, it is necessary to set up the appropriate administrative framework, control activities and physical infrastructure, and to provide the appropriate capacity building. This will be of assistance with regard to the requirement to comply with the international reporting obligations of the Union.\n(5) The necessary financial means should be provided to the fisheries authorities in Mayotte through the use of the shipowners' fees to be paid directly to Mayotte. Such a solution is even more appropriate in view of the strong relationship that has developed between the Seychelles fleet and the local community of the French outermost region of Mayotte. The fishing fleet flagged in the Seychelles has been operating in the Mayotte waters for several years through an arrangement between Mayotte and the vessel shipowners, whereby the shipowners pay a licence fee to Mayotte to fish in its waters. In order to maintain the continuity of fishing operations and subsequent benefits to Mayotte, it is appropriate that all payments related to authorisations and catches under this agreement benefit directly the local community in Mayotte.\n(6) The Agreement should be signed.\n(7) In order to allow, as soon as possible, the continuation of fishing activities by the vessels of the Republic of Seychelles, the Agreement should be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion,", "main_body": ["The signing on behalf of the Union of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union is hereby authorised, subject to the conclusion of the said Agreement.\nThe text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0France shall be authorised to collect, for the account of its outermost region Mayotte, the payments related to authorisations and catches and other fees due by operators of fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles in consideration of the granting of access to waters and marine biological resources within Union waters off the coast of Mayotte in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III, Section 1, paragraphs 8 and 9 and Section 2 of the Annex to the Agreement.
