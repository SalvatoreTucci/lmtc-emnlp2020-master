It is therefore necessary that the delegated act detailing the transport funding priorities is adopted before the adoption of the work programmes.\n(2) According to Article 21(3), the transport funding priorities should take into account the eligible actions contributing to projects of common interest in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) listed under Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013.\n(3) The eligible actions listed in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 are further detailed in Articles 10 and 11 of that Regulation providing the maximum applicable funding rates for those actions. It is therefore appropriate to refer to the actions as listed in those Articles in order to detail the transport funding priorities.\n(4) Projects of common interest as listed in Part I of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 are eligible to the multiannual work programmes referred to in Article 17(3) of that Regulation. Projects not listed in Part I of Annex I but eligible as per Article 7(2) of that Regulation are eligible to the annual work programmes.\n(5) Considering that Article 21(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 refers to the transport specific objectives of Article 4(2) of that Regulation, it is appropriate to refer to those objectives for the purpose of this Regulation.\n(6) Considering that financial instruments are to receive EU contribution under the annual work programmes, it is appropriate to include hereby a corresponding priority.\n(7) Programmes support actions listed in Article 5(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, consisting of technical and administrative assistance expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the Connecting Europe Facility and capped at 1\u00a0% of the financial envelope, will not be covered by the work programmes. However the programme support actions contributing to projects of common interest as provided for in Article 7(2) and referred to in Article 5(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 will be covered by the work programmes and are included hereby with a corresponding priority.\n(8) All resources referred in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, including the resources transferred from the Cohesion Fund will be covered under the same work programmes. According to Article 11 of that Regulation, the resources transferred from the Cohesion Fund will be subject to specific calls for proposals.\n(9) This Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, in order to allow for the timely adoption of the implementing acts provided for in Article 17(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013.", "main_body": ["The text set out in the Annex to this Regulation is added as Part VI of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the first day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 348, 20.12.2013, p. 129.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on Union guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network and repealing Decision No 661/2010/EU (OJ L 348, 20.12.2013, p. 1).\nANNEX\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 the following Part VI is added:\n\u2018PART VI\nTRANSPORT FUNDING PRIORITIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE MULTIANNUAL AND ANNUAL WORK PROGRAMMES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Funding priorities for the multiannual work programmes\n1.1.
