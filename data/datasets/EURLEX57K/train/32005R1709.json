In assessing the extent of the overrun, account should be taken, in the case of Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal, of the estimates for the production of table olives expressed as olive-oil equivalent using the relevant coefficients referred to, for Greece, in Commission Decision 2001/649/EC\u00a0(3), for Spain, in Commission Decision 2001/650/EC\u00a0(4), for France, in Commission Decision 2001/648/EC\u00a0(5), for Italy, in Commission Decision 2001/658/EC\u00a0(6), and, for Portugal, in Commission Decision 2001/670/EC\u00a0(7).\n(2) Article 17a(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that in order to determine the unit amount of the production aid for olive oil that can be paid in advance, the estimated production for the marketing year concerned should be determined. That amount must be fixed at a level that avoids any risk of unwarranted payment to olive growers. The amount also applies to table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent.\n(3) In order to establish the estimated production, Member States must forward to the Commission data for the olive oil and, where appropriate, table olive production estimates for each marketing year. The Commission may use other sources of information. On the basis of that data, the estimated production of olive oil and table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent, should be fixed for each Member State.\n(4) In determining the amount of the advance, account must be taken of the amounts withheld for measures to improve the quality of olive oil and table olive production provided for in Article 5(9) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC and Article 4a(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1638/98\u00a0(8).\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2004/05 marketing year, the estimated production of olive oil, including that referred to in paragraph 2, is:\n\u2014 480\u00a0711 tonnes for Greece;\n\u2014 1\u00a0117\u00a0841 tonnes for Spain;\n\u2014 3\u00a0189 tonnes for France;\n\u2014 951\u00a0528 tonnes for Italy;\n\u2014 45\u00a0050 tonnes for Portugal;\n\u2014 33 tonnes for Slovenia.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2004/05 marketing year, the estimated production of table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent, is:\n\u2014 10\u00a0900 tonnes for Greece, using a coefficient of equivalence of 13\u00a0%;\n\u2014 59\u00a0131 tonnes for Spain, using a coefficient of equivalence of 11,5\u00a0%;\n\u2014 167 tonnes for France, using a coefficient of equivalence of 13\u00a0%;\n\u2014 2\u00a0281 tonnes for Italy, using a coefficient of equivalence of 13\u00a0%;\n\u2014 730 tonnes for Portugal, using a coefficient of equivalence of 11,5\u00a0%.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2004/05 marketing year, the unit amount of the production aid that may be advanced shall be:\n\u2014 117,36\u00a0EUR per 100 kilograms for Greece;\n\u2014 81,50\u00a0EUR per 100 kilograms for Spain;\n\u2014 117,36\u00a0EUR per 100 kilograms for France;\n\u2014 67,12\u00a0EUR per 100 kilograms for Italy;\n\u2014 117,36\u00a0EUR per 100 kilograms for Portugal;\n\u2014 117,36\u00a0EUR per 100 kilograms for Slovenia.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.
