Thiamphenicol is also included in Annex III to that Regulation for porcine species for muscle, skin and fat, liver and kidney. Following examination of the information provided by the applicant for the establishment of final maximum residues limits for thiamphenicol in porcine species, it is considered appropriate to modify the entry of thiamphenicol in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 to all food-producing species for muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk, excluding animals which produce eggs for human consumption. The maximum residue limits for fat, liver and kidney should not apply to fin fish.\n(3) The substance fenvalerate is included in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for bovine for muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk. Those provisional maximum residue limits expire on 1 July 2006. Following examination of the information provided by the applicant for the establishment of final maximum residues for fenvalerate limits for bovine species, it is considered appropriate to include fenvalerate in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for bovine species for muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk.\n(4) The substance meloxicam is included in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for bovine, porcine and equidae species for muscle, liver and kidney as well as for bovine species for milk. Following examination of an application for the establishment of maximum residues limits for meloxicam in rabbits and caprine species for milk, it is considered appropriate to modify the entry of meloxicam in that Annex for rabbits and caprine species for muscle, liver and kidney as well as to caprine species for milk.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) An adequate period should be allowed before the applicability of this Regulation in order to enable Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary in the light of this Regulation to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(2) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 8 February 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.
