whereas in such case the conditions for the inclusion of azoxystrobin in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC will also need to be amended pursuant to Article 6(1) of that Directive;\nWhereas the dossier and the information from the review have also been submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants for consultation;\nWhereas it has appeared from the assessments made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a), (b) and (3) of the Directive, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined; whereas therefore it is necessary to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing the active substance concerned can be granted in accordance with the provisions of the Directive;\nWhereas after inclusion a reasonable period is necessary to permit Member States to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC on plant protection products containing azoxystrobin and in particular to review, within this period, existing provisional authorisations or to grant, by the end of this period at the latest, new authorisations in accordance with the provisions of the Directive; whereas a longer period may also be required for plant protection products containing azoxystrobin and other active substances included in Annex I;\nWhereas it is appropriate to provide that the finalised review report (except for confidential information in the meaning of Article 14 of the Directive) is kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties;\nWhereas the review report is required for the proper implementation by the Member States, of several sections of the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI to the Directive, where these principles refer to the evaluation of the Annex II data which were submitted for the purpose of the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I to the Directive;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Azoxystrobin is hereby designated as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, as set out in the Annex hereto.", "1.
