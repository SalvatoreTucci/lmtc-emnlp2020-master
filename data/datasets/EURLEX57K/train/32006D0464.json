However, a report of a pest-risk assessment based on limited available scientific information has demonstrated that it may be one of the most damaging insects to chestnut (Castanea Mill.). It could strongly reduce nut production and quality and there is some evidence it may even kill the trees. Chestnuts are often grown on marginal land in hills or mountains. Damage resulting from the spread of the insect could halt production of chestnuts for human consumption in those areas and thus lead to economic and environmental degradation.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to take provisional measures against the introduction into and spread within the Community of the said harmful organism.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision should apply to the introduction or the spread of the said organism, the production and movement of Castanea plants within the Community, the control of the organism and to a survey for the presence or continued absence of the said harmful organism in the Member States.\n(7) It is appropriate that the results of the measures be regularly assessed in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in particular on the basis of information to be provided by the Member States. Possible subsequent measures will be considered in the light of the results of that assessment.\n(8) Member States should adapt, if necessary, their legislation in order to comply with this Decision.\n(9) The results of the measures should be reviewed by 1 February 2008.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Definition\nIn this Decision, \u2018plants\u2019 means plants or parts of plants of the genus Castanea Mill., intended for planting, other than fruit and seeds.", "Measures against Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu\nThe introduction into and spread within the Community of Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the organism\u2019, shall be prohibited.", "Import of plants\nPlants may be introduced into the Community only if:\n(a) they comply with the measures laid down in point 1 of Annex I, and\n(b) they are, on entry into the Community, inspected for the presence of the organism, in accordance with Article 13a(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC, and found free from it.", "Movement of plants within the Community\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Article 5(3)(a) and Annex II, Part II, plants originating in the Community or imported into the Community pursuant to Article 3 of this Decision may only be moved from their place of production in the Community, including, where appropriate, garden centres, if they meet the conditions laid down in point 2 of Annex I.", "Surveys and notifications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall conduct official annual surveys for the presence of the organism or evidence of infestation by the organism in their territory.\nWithout prejudice to Article 16(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC, the results of those surveys shall be notified to the Commission and to the other Member States by 31 December of each year.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any suspected occurrence or confirmed presence of the organism shall immediately be notified to the responsible official bodies.\n(a) Member States may require that the movement into or within their territory of plants, is subject to a traceability system, which may include a declaration of movement to the responsible official bodies by the person responsible for the movement.\n(b) Member States may require a declaration of planting to be made to the responsible official bodies by the persons responsible for the planting.", "Establishment of demarcated zones\nWhen the results of the surveys referred to in Article 5(1) or the notification referred to in Article 5(2) confirm the presence of the organism in an area, or there is evidence of the establishment of the organism by other means, Member States shall define demarcated zones and take official measures as laid down in points I and II respectively of Annex II.", "Compliance\nMember States shall, if necessary, amend the measures which they have adopted to protect themselves against the introduction and spread of the organism in such a manner that those measures comply with this Decision and shall forthwith inform the Commission of those measures.", "Review\nThis Decision shall be reviewed by 1 February 2008 at the latest.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 June 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.
