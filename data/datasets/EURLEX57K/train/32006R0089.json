Only the terms listed in Annex II to that Regulation may be used and Annex III thereto lists the requirements that must be satisfied in order to be able to use those terms.\n(4) Among the specific requirements that must be satisfied in order to market eggs using the term \u2018free-range eggs\u2019, access to open-air runs is essential.\n(5) Restrictions, including veterinary restrictions, adopted under Community law to protect public and animal health, may restrict the access of poultry to open-air runs.\n(6) Where producers can no longer satisfy all the rearing conditions laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02295/2003, they must, in the interests of consumers, cease to use the compulsory labelling relating to the rearing method.\n(7) In order to take account of the possible economic consequences of such temporary restrictions, since the whole of the sector needs a reasonable adjustment period, especially as regards labelling, and provided that product quality is not substantially affected, provision should be made for a transitional period during which producers can continue to use the labelling relating to the \u2018free-range\u2019 method of rearing.\n(8) A derogation from access to open-air runs is explicitly provided for in the first indent of point 1(a) of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02295/2003 in the event of \u2018temporary restrictions imposed by veterinary authorities\u2019.\n(9) Since the duration of temporary restrictions during which producers may continue to use the term \u2018free-range\u2019, although hens no longer have access to open-air runs, is not specified, a time-limit should be laid down in order to protect the interests of consumers.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No\u00a02295/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["The first indent of point 1(a) of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 2295/2003 is hereby replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 hens have continuous daytime access to open-air runs; any derogation from this requirement granted because of restrictions, including veterinary restrictions adopted under Community law, must not exceed 12 weeks.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 January 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 173, 6.7.1990, p. 5.
