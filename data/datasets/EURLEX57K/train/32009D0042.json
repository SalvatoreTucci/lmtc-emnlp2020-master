The European Security Strategy acknowledges the United Nations Charter as the fundamental framework for international relations. Strengthening the United Nations, equipping it to fulfil its responsibilities and to act effectively, is a priority of the European Union.\n(2) On 6 December 2006 the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 61/89 entitled \u2018Towards an arms trade treaty: establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms\u2019.\n(3) In its conclusions of 11 December 2006, the Council welcomed the formal start of the process towards the elaboration of a legally binding international Arms Trade Treaty and noted with appreciation that a clear majority of UN Member States had supported the above referred Resolution, including all EU Member States. The Council reaffirmed that the EU and its Member States would play an active role in this process, and underlined the importance of cooperation in this process with other States and regional organisations.\n(4) The United Nations Secretary-General set up a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) of 28 members to continue the consideration of a possible Arms Trade Treaty. The GGE met throughout 2008 and presented its conclusions during the ministerial week of the 63rd General Assembly. The Group concluded that further consideration was required and that efforts should be carried out, on a step-by-step basis, in an open and transparent manner, within the framework of the United Nations. The GGE encouraged those States in a position to do so, to render assistance to States in need, upon request.\n(5) In its conclusions of 10 December 2007, the Council underlined the importance of the UN-appointed GGE which it encouraged to move the process forward. The Council expressed its firm belief that a comprehensive, legally binding instrument, consistent with existing responsibilities of States under relevant international law and establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms, would be a major contribution to tackling the undesirable and irresponsible proliferation of conventional arms.\n(6) In October 2008 the First Committee of the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution \u2018Towards an arms trade treaty: establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms\u2019. All EU Member States co-sponsored the text.\n(7) The United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (Unidir) supported this process by undertaking a two-part study consisting of two in-depth analyses of UN Member States\u2019 views on the feasibility, scope and draft parameters of an Arms Trade Treaty. Unidir\u2019s analyses contributed to advancing discussions on an Arms Trade Treaty through the identification of areas of consensus and divergence, as well as neglected areas. The analyses served as a useful input to the GGE. For these reasons, it is reasonable to entrust Unidir with the technical implementation of the activities under this Decision.\n(8) Based on the above Council conclusions, the EU should support this process, in order to reinforce the work that has been accomplished to date, by opening the debate to include States not members of the GGE, as well as to other actors such as civil society and industry, to develop the understanding of the issue and to contribute to broadening the recommendations made by the GGE,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of promoting among third countries the process leading towards an Arms Trade Treaty, the European Union shall support activities in order to further the following objectives:\n(a) increase awareness by national and regional actors, United Nations Member States, civil society and industry, of the current international discussions around an Arms Trade Treaty;\n(b) reinforce the purpose of the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on an Arms Trade Treaty and strengthen the United Nations as the only forum that can deliver a truly universal instrument;\n(c) contribute to the better involvement of all United Nations Member States and regional organisations in the Arms Trade Treaty process;\n(d) encourage the exchange of views between States which are part of the GGE and those which are not part of it;\n(e) foster debate among United Nations Member States, particularly among those which are not part of the GGE;\n(f) promote an exchange of views among United Nations Member States, regional organisations, civil society and industry;\n(g) identify possible elements, the scope and the implications of an Arms Trade Treaty; and\n(h) share these debates and views with the whole international community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For achieving the above objectives, the EU will undertake the following project:\n\u2014 organisation of a launching event, six regional seminars, a concluding seminar, including the dissemination of results, and a side-event in the margins of the 1st Committee (UNGA 64th session).\nA detailed description is set out in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Presidency, assisted by the Secretary-General of the Council/High Representative (SG/HR) for the CFSP, shall be responsible for implementing this Decision.
