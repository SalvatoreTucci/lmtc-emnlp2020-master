The allocation mechanism should ensure that all undertakings requesting a new quota receive an appropriate share of the quantities to be allocated.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 25(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009,", "main_body": ["The quotas for controlled substances for laboratory and analytical uses shall be allocated to producers and importers to which no production or import license was issued in the years 2007 to 2009 in accordance with the mechanism set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 June 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 286, 31.10.2009, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAllocation mechanism\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determination of the quantity for allocation to undertakings for which no production or import of controlled substances for essential laboratory and analytical uses had been licensed in the years 2007 to 2009 (new undertakings)\nEach undertaking for which production or import of controlled substances for essential laboratory and analytical uses was licensed in the years 2007 to 2009 receives a quota corresponding to the quantity requested in its declaration referred to in Article 10(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009, but which shall not exceed 130\u00a0% of the annual average of the calculated level of controlled substances licensed for this undertaking in the years 2007 to 2009.\nThe sum of these allocations is subtracted from 110 ODP tonnes to determine the quantity to be allocated to new undertakings (quantity for allocation in Phase 1).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Phase 1\nEach new undertaking receives an allocation corresponding to the quantity requested in its declaration, but no more than a pro rata share of the allocation quantity for Phase 1.
