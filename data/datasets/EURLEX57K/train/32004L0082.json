In addition, in order to ensure the greater effectiveness of this objective, the financial penalties currently provided for by the Member States for cases where carriers fail to meet their obligations should be harmonised to the extent possible, taking into account the differences in legal systems and practices between the Member States.\n(2) The European\u00a0Council of 25 and 26\u00a0March\u00a02004 adopted a Declaration on combating terrorism stressing the need to expedite examination of measures in this area and take work forward on the proposed Council Directive on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data with a view to an early conclusion on this measure.\n(3) It is important to avoid a vacuum in the Community's action in combating illegal immigration.\n(4) As from 1\u00a0May\u00a02004 the Council can no longer act on an initiative of a Member State.\n(5) The Council has exhausted all possibilities to obtain in time the opinion of the European\u00a0Parliament.\n(6) Under these exceptional circumstances the Directive should be adopted without the opinion of the European\u00a0Parliament.\n(7) The obligations to be imposed on carriers by virtue of this Directive are complementary to those established pursuant to the provisions of Article 26 of the 1990 Schengen Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985, as supplemented by Council Directive 2001/51/EC\u00a0(2), the two types of obligation serving the same objective of curbing migratory flows and combating illegal immigration.\n(8) Without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3), the freedom of the Member States to retain or introduce additional obligations for aircarriers or some categories of other carriers, including information or data in relation to return tickets, whether referred to in this Directive or not, should not be affected.\n(9) In order to combat illegal immigration more effectively and in order to ensure the greater effectiveness of this objective, it is essential that, without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC, account be taken at the earliest opportunity of any technological innovation, especially with reference to the integration and use of biometric features in the information to be provided by the carriers.\n(10) Member States should ensure that in any proceedings brought against carriers which may result in the application of penalties, the rights of defence and the right of appeal against such decisions can be exercised effectively.\n(11) These measures take up the control options set out in the Decision of the Executive\u00a0Committee of Schengen (SCH/Com-ex (94) 17-rev. 4), aimed at enabling border\u00a0checks to be increased and providing for sufficient time to enable detailed and comprehensive checks to be carried out on all passengers through the transmission of passenger data to the authorities responsible for carrying out such controls.\n(12) Directive 95/46/EC applies with regard to the processing of personal data by the authorities of the Member States. This means, that whereas it would be legitimate to process the passenger data transmitted for the performance of border checks also for the purposes of allowing their use as evidence in proceedings aiming at the enforcement of the laws and regulations on entry and immigration, including their provisions on the protection of public policy (ordre\u00a0public) and national security, any further processing in a way incompatible with those purposes would run counter to the principle set out in Article 6(1)(b) of Directive\u00a095/46/EC. Member States should provide for a system of sanctions to be applied in the event of use contrary to the purpose of the present Directive.\n(13) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Directive builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Directive whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(14) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Directive constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point E, of Council Decision\u00a01999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement\u00a0(5).\n(15) The United\u00a0Kingdom is taking part in this Directive in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(6).\n(16) Ireland is taking part in this Directive in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article\u00a06(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(7).\n(17) This Directive constitutes an act building upon the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the 2003 Act of Accession,", "main_body": ["Objective\nThis Directive aims at improving border controls and combating illegal immigration by the transmission of advance passenger data by carriers to the competent national authorities.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Directive:\n(a) \u2018carrier\u2019 means any natural or legal person whose occupation it is to provide passenger transport by air;\n(b) \u2018external borders\u2019 means the external borders of the Member States with third countries;\n(c) \u2018border control\u2019 means a check carried out at a border in response exclusively to an intention to cross that border, regardless of any other consideration;\n(d) \u2018border crossing point\u2019 means any crossing point authorised by the competent authorities for crossing external borders;\n(e) \u2018personal data\u2019, \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 and \u2018personal data filing system\u2019 have the meaning as stipulated under Article 2 of Directive 95/46/EC.", "Data transmission\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall take the necessary steps to establish an obligation for carriers to transmit at the request of the authorities responsible for carrying out checks on persons at external borders, by the end of check-in, information concerning the passengers they will carry to an authorised border crossing point through which these persons will enter the territory of a Member State.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The information referred to above shall comprise:\n\u2014 the number and type of travel document used,\n\u2014 nationality,\n\u2014 full names,\n\u2014 the date of birth,\n\u2014 the border crossing point of entry into the territory of the Member States,\n\u2014 code of transport,\n\u2014 departure and arrival time of the transportation,\n\u2014 total number of passengers carried on that transport,\n\u2014 the initial point of embarkation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case the transmission of the above mentioned data does not discharge the obligations and responsibilities laid down in the provisions of Article 26 of the Schengen Convention for carriers, as supplemented by Directive 2001/51/EC.", "Sanctions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall take the necessary measures to impose sanctions on carriers which, as a result of fault, have not transmitted data or have transmitted incomplete or false data.
