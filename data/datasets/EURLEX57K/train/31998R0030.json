Aid for the land-improvement works referred to in the additional plan may be granted by the French authorities only in respect of areas under cane which have received no aid pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1487/92.\nPlots shall, however, be eligible for the aid if they have received aid pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1487/92 for removal of large stones and aid applications have been submitted for removal of small stones.", "The additional restructuring plan shall be implemented before 31 December 1999, in accordance with the rules and conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1487/92 and in this Regulation.", "France shall notify to the Commission, as a supplement to the notification referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1487/92, the method of administration including, in particular, the conditions of eligibility and the inspection measures to be adopted within one month following the entry into force of this Regulation as well as, every six months, the progress reports on the additional plan.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 April 1997.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 January 1998.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 356, 24. 12. 1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 267, 9. 11. 1995, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 156, 10. 6. 1992, p. 7.\n(4) OJ L 34, 13. 2. 1996, p. 16."}
