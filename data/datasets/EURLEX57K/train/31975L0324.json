However, any test system enabling a result equivalent to that of the water bath method to be obtained may be used by the person responsible for marketing, on his own responsibility and with the agreement of the Committee referred to in Article 6 of the Directive.\n6.2. Examples of inspection tests which may be carried out by Member States   6.2.1. Test on unfilled containers\nThe test pressure shall be applied for 25 seconds on five containers selected at random from a homogeneous batch of 2 500 unfilled containers, i.e. manufactured from the same materials by the same continuous batch manufacturing process, or from a batch constituting one hour's production.\nIf any one of these containers does not pass the test, ten additional containers shall be drawn at random from the same batch and put through the same test.\nIf any one of these aerosol containers does not pass the test, the whole batch shall be unsuitable for use.\n6.2.2. Tests on filled aerosol dispensers\nAir and water-tightness inspection tests shall be carried out by immersing a representative number of filled aerosol dispensers in a bath of water. The temperature of the bath and the period of immersion must be such as to enable the contents of the aerosol dispenser to attain a uniform temperature of 50\u00ba C during the time required to ensure that there is no bursting or rupture.\nAny batch of aerosol dispensers which does not pass these tests must be considered unsuitable for use."}
