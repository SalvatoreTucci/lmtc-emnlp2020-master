whereas the conditions which the storage agencies must meet in order to be approved should be laid down in particular as regards the steps that are to be taken to ensure that the products are stored properly;\n(2) Whereas the requirements regarding the quality and presentation of the products offered for storage should be determined in such a way as to ensure that storage is carried out under optimum conditions and to prevent it becoming a more attractive outlet than the commercial markets;
