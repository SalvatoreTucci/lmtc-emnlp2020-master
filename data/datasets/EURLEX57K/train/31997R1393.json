whereas the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 are applicable to those quotas;\nWhereas the Commission accordingly adopted Regulation (EC) No 738/94 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 983/96 (6), laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas these provisions apply to the administration of the above quotas subject to the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas certain characteristics of China's economy, the seasonal nature of some of the products and the time needed for transport mean that orders for products subject to quota are generally placed before the beginning of the quota year; whereas it is therefore important to ensure that administrative constraints do not impede the realization of the planned imports; whereas in order not to affect the continuity of trade flows, the arrangements for allocating and administering the 1998 quotas should accordingly be adopted before the start of the quota year;\nWhereas after examination of the different administrative methods provided for by Regulation (EC) No 520/94, the method based on traditional trade flows should be adopted; whereas under this method quota tranches are divided into two portions, one of which is reserved for traditional importers and the other for other applicants;\nWhereas this has proved to be the best way of ensuring the continuity of business for the Community importers concerned and avoiding any disturbance of trade flows;\nWhereas, however, the introduction of a Community system must ensure progressive access by non-traditional importers; whereas in the light of all these factors a balance must therefore be sought in determining the portions to be allocated to the two categories of importers; whereas, to this end, it is appropriate that the portion set aside for non-traditional importers should be increased as compared to 1997;\nWhereas the reference period used for allocating the portion of the quota set aside for traditional importers in earlier regulations on the administration of these quotas should be updated to ensure open access to the quotas; whereas that update should be based on the latest period for which complete data is available; whereas the year 1995 is therefore a suitable reference period, it being the only recent representative year of the normal trend of trade flows in the products in question for which full customs data are available; whereas traditional importers must therefore prove that they have imported products originating in China and covered by the quotas in question in the year 1995;\nWhereas it has been found in the past that the method provided for in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94, which is based on the order in which applications are received, may not be an appropriate way of allocating that portion of the quota reserved for non-traditional importers; whereas, consequently, in accordance with Article 2 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 520/94, an alternative method of apportioning the quota should be determined; whereas, to this end, it is appropriate to provide for allocation in proportion to the quantities requested, on the basis of a simultaneous examination of import licence applications actually lodged, in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94;\nWhereas in order to ensure that the quotas can be efficiently allocated and used, any speculative applications should be excluded, and it is furthermore necessary to allocate economically significant quantities; whereas to this end the amount that any non-traditional importer may request should be restricted to a set volume or value;\nWhereas for the purposes of quota allocation, a time limit must be set for the submission of licence applications by traditional and other importers;\nWhereas with a view to optimum use of quotas, licence applications for imports of footwear under quotas which refer to several CN codes must specify the quantities required for each code;\nWhereas the Member States must inform the Commission of the import licence applications received, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas the information about traditional importers' previous imports must be expressed in the same units as the quota in question; whereas if the quota is set in ecus, the counter-value of the currency in which previous imports are expressed must be calculated in accordance with Article 18 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97 (8);\nWhereas in view of the special nature of transactions concerning products subject to quota, and in particular the time needed for transport, the import licences should expire on 31 December 1998;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the administration of quotas set up pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down for 1998 specific provisions for the administration of the quantitative quotas referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 519/94.\nRegulation (EC) No 738/94 laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 shall apply, subject to the specific provisions of this Regulation.", "1.

Instead of the documents referred to in the first indent of Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 applicants may enclose with their licence applications documents drawn up and certified by the competent national authorities on the basis of available customs information as evidence of the imports of the product in question during the calendar year 1995 carried out by themselves or, where applicable, by the operator whose activities they have taken over.\n4.
