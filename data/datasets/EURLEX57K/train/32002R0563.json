Using this information the Commission shall proceed every three years, and before 1 January 2002 for the first time, to a review of the maximum levels for nitrates in lettuce and spinach, with the overall objective of reducing the said levels.\n(4) Annual monitoring data from Member States show reductions in levels of nitrates in lettuce. Lower maximum levels for certain categories of lettuce are reasonably achievable based upon good production practice. In some regions nitrate levels are reported to be frequently higher than those set in the Annex of Regulation (EC) No 466/2001, although the general trend shows that the levels of nitrate in lettuce are decreasing. The levels of nitrate in spinach show no clear trend for reduction. Some Member States need to maintain the established transitional period to authorise the placing on the home market of lettuce and/or spinach grown and intended for consumption in their territory. For lettuce this transitional period should be time-limited, but for spinach an end date is not yet foreseen.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 3(1) is replaced by the following: \"1. Member States may, where justified, authorise for a transitional period the placing on the market of fresh lettuces and fresh spinach, grown and intended for consumption in their territory, with nitrate levels higher than those set as maximum levels in points 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4 of the Annex provided that codes of good agricultural practice are applied to achieve gradual progress towards the levels laid down in this Regulation.\nThe transitional period:\n(a) with regard to lettuces, shall cease on 1 January 2005;\n(b) with regard to spinach, shall be reviewed not later than 1 January 2005.\nMember States shall inform the other Member States and the Commission each year of steps taken to implement the first sub-paragraph.\"\n2.
