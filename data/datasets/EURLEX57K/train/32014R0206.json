The adjustment of the quantity of allowances to be issued from 1 January 2013 pursuant to Article 9a(1) of that Directive is determined taking into account the GWP listed in Annex III to Decision 15/CP.17 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. As Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 applies from 1 January 2013, this Regulation should also apply from that date in order to ensure consistency of all greenhouse gas emission data reported throughout the entire eight-year trading period.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex VI to Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 of 21 June 2012 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 181, 12.7.2012, p. 30).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0FCCC/CP/2011/9/Add.2, p. 23.\nANNEX\nTable 6 of Annex VI to Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Table 6:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Global warming potentials\nGas Global warming potential\nN2O 298 t CO2(e)/t N2O\nCF4 7\u00a0390 t CO2(e)/t CF4\nC2F6 12\u00a0200 t CO2(e)/t C2F6\u2019"}
