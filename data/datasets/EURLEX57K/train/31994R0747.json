whereas the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 establishing a Community procedure for administering quantitative quotas are applicable to those quotas;\nWhereas the Commission accordingly adopted Regulation (EC) No 738/94 (3) laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas these provisions apply to the administration of the above quotas subject to the provisions of  this Regulation;\nWhereas after examination of the different administrative methods provided for by that Regulation, the method based on traditional trade flows should be adopted; whereas under this method quotas are divided into two portions, one of which is reserved  for traditional importers and the other for other applicants;\nWhereas this method should ensure a smooth transition between the previous system, which was marked by disparities between the Member States' import arrangements for the products concerned, and the uniform system resulting from the introduction of the  Community quotas in question;\nWhereas this method takes account of the traditional import trade flows formed under the previous system; whereas, however, the introduction of a Community system must ensure progressive access by non-traditional importers; whereas the portion set aside  for other applicants must make due allowance for the disparities in the above import arrangements in accordance with Article 6 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas in the light of all these factors a balance must therefore be sought in determining  the portion to be allocated to the two categories of importers;\nWhereas to qualify for the allocation of the part of the quota set aside for them, traditional importers must be able to demonstrate that during 1991 and 1992 they imported products originating in China covered by the quotas in question; whereas these  two years constitute an appropriate reference period for which full statistics are available showing normal trade flows for the products in question;\nWhereas for the portion set aside for other importers and allocated on a 'first come, first serve' basis, allowance must be made in setting the predetermined quantity which each importer may obtain for the need to assign economically significant  quantities having regard to the nature of commercial practice for the product concerned, while at the same time remaining accessible to small importers;\nWhereas for the purpose of quota allocation, a time limit must be set for the submission of licence applications by traditional and other importers, taking account of the need to ensure simple, clear and effective administration of quotas; whereas the  initial procedure for making allocations to other applicants should be implemented by stages;\nWhereas with a view to optimum use of quotas, licence applications for imports of footwear, under quotas which refer to several CN headings, must specify the quantities required for each CN heading;\nWhereas the Member States must inform the Commission of the import licence applications received, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas the information about traditional importers' previous imports  must be broken down by reference year and expressed in the unit of the quota in question; whereas if the quota is set in ecus, the counter-value of the currency in which previous imports are expressed must be calculated in accordance with Article 18 of  Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (4);\nWhereas in view of the special nature of transactions concerning products covered by quotas, the period of validity of import licences should be set at six months from the date of issue by the Member States;\nWhereas measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up under Regulation (EC) No 520/94,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down specific provisions for the administration of the quantitative quotas referred to in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 of 7 March 1994, for the period 15 March to 31 December 1994.\nRegulation (EC) No 738/94 laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 shall apply, subject to the specific provisions of this Regulation.", "The quantitative quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be allocated using the method based on traditional trade flows, referred to in Article 2 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 520/94.", "1.

For the verification and utilization of the Community balance available, the following provisions shall apply;\n- the competent authorities in the Member States shall notify the Commission as from 26 April 1994 at 10 a.m. Brussels time, and up to 29 April 1994 at 5 p.m. Brussels time, of the import licence applications received in chronological order of receipt,\n- the Commission shall examine all the applications notified and, on completion of this examination, send notification to confirm the applications that can be met and inform the Member States of the rate of depletion of the Community balance and, where  applicable, of the date on which the procedure referred to above may be repeated. Should the quota be exceeded during the initial implementation phase, the Commission shall convene a meeting of the Committee set up under Regulation (EC) No 520/94 to  deal with the matter,\n- normally the notifications referred to in the previous paragraphs shall be communicated electronically within the integrated network set up for this purpose, unless for imperative technical reasons it is necessary to use other means of communication  temporarily. Notification codes for each quota are listed in Annex III.", "Any import licence application for one of the footwear quotas covering two CN headings must give the breakdown of the quantities applied for by CN heading.", "The period of validity of the import licences issued by the competent authorities in the Member States shall be six months from the date of issue.", "0\nThis Regulation shall
