Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) A preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM 7133 was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on calves by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004\u00a0(3). That preparation was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of a preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM 7133, as a feed additive for calves for rearing, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 13 March 2013\u00a0(4) that, under the proposed conditions of use in feed, the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM 7133 does not have an adverse effect on animal and consumer health, and for the environment and it has the potential to improve the zootechnical performance in target animals. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM 7133 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the provisions on Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM 7133 contained in Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004 should be deleted. Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004 should be therefore amended accordingly.\n(7) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "In Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004 the provisions on E 1706, Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM 7133 are deleted.", "The preparation specified in the Annex and feed containing that preparation, which are produced and labelled before 27 May 2014 in accordance with the rules applicable before 27 November 2013 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feeding-stuffs (OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004 of 14 July 2004 concerning the permanent authorisation of certain additives and the provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs (OJ L 243, 15.7.2004, p. 10).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(4):3175.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0% or of milk replacer\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
