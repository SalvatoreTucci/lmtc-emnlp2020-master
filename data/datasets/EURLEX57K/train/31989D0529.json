The Commission must therefore give a ruling, under Article 10 of this Decision, as to whether they comply with the objectives and criteria set out in that Decision and whether they are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nII\nCoal production is not economically viable in the long term, so that a restructuring plan was needed. Since this plan was introduced in 1987, production capacity has been halved. At the end of 1988 it amounted to three million tonnes, following the early closure of three of the five collieries.\nThe amount of aid linked to current production is thus about 45 % down on the 1986 figure.\nThe decreasing levels of aid which the Belgian Government intends to grant, their temporary nature and the implementation of a clearly defined restructuring plan are in accordance with the conditions laid down for the application of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nThe aid to cover operating losses is aimed at facilitating the implementation of the restructuring programme for the Campine coalfield, as decided by ministerial decree in January 1987. In accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision, this contributes to solving the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry.\nIn accordance with Article 12 of the Decision, coal undertakings shall be authorized, where necessary, to grant rebates on their list prices or production costs, for deliveries of coking coal, blast-furnace coke and coal for injection into blast-furnaces for the iron and steel industry of the Community under long-term contract; these rebates must not cause the delivered prices of Community coal and coke to work out lower than those which would be charged for coal from non-member countries and coke made from non-member country coking coal.\nAccording to the Belgian Government, the aid to sales of coking coal, blast-furnace coke and coal for injection into blast-furnaces for the iron and steel industry of the Community, totalling Bfrs 223 300 000, will make up the difference between world market prices and production costs for 95 000 tonnes. The aid therefore conforms to Article 4 of the Decision.\nThe sales aid for supplies of coal, blast-furnace coke and coal for injection into blast-furnaces for the iron and steel industry of the Community forms part of the restructuring programme. In accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision, this contributes to solving the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry.\nThe aid granted to maintain a qualified workforce of underground staff is a long-standing specific measure which is conducted separately from the aid pursuant to Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Decision. The aid therefore conforms to Article 6 of the Decision.\nThe object of the measure is to maintain a skilled workforce, as part of the restructuring programme for the industry.\nIn view of the transitional nature of the aid, its phased reduction and its inclusion in the restructuring programme, it complies with the objectives and conditions laid down in Article 2 of the Decision.\nTherefore the aid to be granted by the Belgian Government to the coal industry in 1989 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nThis Decision is without prejudice to the compatibility with the Treaties of the rules governing sales of Belgian coal to electricity producers.\nPursuant to Article 11 (2) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 3 to 6 thereof. The Commission must therefore be informed in particular of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["Belgium is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Bfrs 6 934 900 000 to the Belgian coal industry for the 1989 calendar year.
