Article 8(1) of that Regulation provides that movements of animals, their semen, ova and embryos, from a holding or semen collection or storage centre located in a restricted zone to another holding or semen collection or storage centre are to be exempted from that exit ban provided that they comply with the conditions set out in Annex III to that Regulation or with any other appropriate animal health guarantees based on a positive outcome of a risk assessment of measures against the spread of the bluetongue virus and protection against attacks by vectors, required by the competent authority of the place of origin and approved by the competent authority of the place of destination, prior to the movement of such animals.\n(3) Article 9(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 provides that, until 31 December 2010, and by way of derogation from the conditions set out in Annex III to that Regulation, Member States of destination may require that the movement of certain animals which are covered by the exemption, provided for in Article 8(1) thereof, be subjected to additional conditions, on the basis of a risk assessment taking into account the entomological and epidemiological conditions in which animals are being introduced. Those additional conditions specify that the animals must be less than 90 days old, they must have been kept since birth in vector protected confinement and they must have been subject to certain tests referred to in Annex III to that Regulation.\n(4) Fifteen Member States and Norway have notified the Commission that they have applied that transitional measure. The outcomes of the risk assessments that were carried out, which are publicly available on the Commission\u2019s website, show that the introduction of bluetongue in those Member States and in Norway as a result of animal movements from restricted zones could have a major negative impact.\n(5) The overall disease situation as regards bluetongue has improved considerably since 2008. However the virus is still present in parts of the Union.\n(6) For the sake of harmonized implementation, Member States have requested for specific criteria for the \u2018vector proof establishment\u2019 which is an important requirement for a number of the conditions set out in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 and aims at the protection of animals against attacks by vectors. Currently, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is working on a definition of a vector-protected establishment or facility. The outcome of this work shall serve as input for the Commission to define criteria for the vector proof establishment as referred to in Annex III of the Regulation.\n(7) Pending the development of the criteria for a vector proof establishment, the period of application of the transitional measures provided for in Article 9(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should be prolonged for another six months.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In the introductory phrase of Article 9a(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, the date \u201831 December 2010\u2019 is replaced by \u201830 June 2011\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 74.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 283, 27.10.2007, p. 37."}
