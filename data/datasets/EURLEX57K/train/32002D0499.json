The total number of plants shall not exceed quantities which have been determined by the importing Member State, having regard to available quarantine facilities.\n3. Prior to export to the European Community, the plants shall have been grown, held and trained for at least two consecutive years in officially registered nurseries, which are subject to an officially supervised control regime. The annual lists of the registered nurseries shall be made available to the Commission, at the latest by 1 March 2004. These lists shall be immediately transmitted to the Member States. They shall include the number of plants grown in each of these nurseries, as far as they are deemed suitable for dispatch to the Community, under the conditions laid down in this Decision.\n4. For Juniperus plants, the plants of the genera Chaenomeles Lindl., Crataegus L., Cydonia Mill., Juniperus L., Malus Mill., Photinia Ldl. and Pyrus L., which have been grown in the two last years prior to dispatch in the abovementioned naturally or artificially dwarfed plants nurseries and their immediate vicinity, shall have been officially inspected at least six times a year at appropriate intervals for the presence of harmful organisms of concern. For Chamaecyparis and Pinus plants, the plants of the genus Chamaecyparis Spach and of the genus Pinus L., which have been grown in the abovementioned naturally or artificially dwarfed plants nurseries and their immediate vicinity, shall have been officially inspected at least six times a year at appropriate intervals, for the presence of harmful organisms of concern.\nThe harmful organisms of concern are:\n(a) for Juniperus plants,\n- Aschistonyx eppoi Inouye,\n- Gymnosporangium asiaticum Miyabe ex Yamada and G. yamadae Miyabe ex Yamada,\n- Oligonychus perditus Pritchard et Baker,\n- Popillia japonica Newman,\n- any other harmful organism which is not known to occur in the Community;\n(b) for Chamaecyparis plants,\n- Popillia japonica Newman,\n- any other harmful organism which is not known to occur in the Community;\n(c) for Pinus plants,\n- Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner &  Buehrer) Nickle et al.,\n- Cercoseptoria pini-densiflorae (Hori &  Nambu) Deighton,\n- Coleosporium phellodendri Komr,\n- Coleosporium asterum (Dietel) Sydow,\n- Coleosporium eupatorii Arthur,\n- Cronartium quercuum (Berk.)
