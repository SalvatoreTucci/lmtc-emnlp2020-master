That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns a request of a new use of a preparation of Pediococcus acidilactici CNCM MA 18/5M as a feed additive for use in water for drinking on weaned piglets, pigs for fattening, laying hens and chickens for fattening, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that preparation of Pediococcus acidilactici CNCM MA 18/5M was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005\u00a0(2) and for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2036/2005\u00a0(3), for 10\u00a0years for salmonids and shrimps by Commission Regulation (EC) No 911/2009\u00a0(4), for weaned piglets by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1120/2010\u00a0(5), for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EU) No 212/2011\u00a0(6) and for all fish other than salmonids by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 95/2013\u00a0(7).\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 12 June 2012\u00a0(8) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Pediococcus acidilactici CNCM MA 18/5M, does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that it has the potential to improve the performance in target species.\n(6) The assessment of the preparation of Pediococcus acidilactici CNCM MA 18/5M shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 195, 27.7.2005, p. 6.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 15.12.2005, p. 13.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 257, 30.9.2009, p. 10.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 317, 3.12.2010, p. 12.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 59, 4.3.2011, p. 1.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 33, 2.2.2013, p. 19.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(7):2776.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/l of water for drinking\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
