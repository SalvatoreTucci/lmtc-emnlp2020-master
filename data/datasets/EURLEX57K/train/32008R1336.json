That Regulation will replace Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27\u00a0June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances\u00a0(4) as well as Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31\u00a0May 1999 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations\u00a0(5).\n(2) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01272/2008 builds on the experience with Directives 67/548/EEC and\u00a01999/45/EC and incorporates the criteria for classification and labelling of substances and mixtures provided for by the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) which has been adopted at the international level, within the structure of the United Nations.\n(3) Certain provisions on classification and labelling laid down in Directives 67/548/EEC and\u00a01999/45/EC also serve for the purpose of application of other Community legislation, such as Regulation (EC) No\u00a0648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31\u00a0March 2004 on detergents\u00a0(6).\n(4) An analysis of the potential effects of replacing Directives 67/548/EEC and\u00a01999/45/EC and the introduction of the GHS criteria led to the conclusion that by adapting the references to those Directives in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0648/2004, the scope of that act should be maintained.\n(5) The transition from the criteria for classification contained in Directives 67/548/EEC and\u00a01999/45/EC should be fully completed on 1\u00a0June 2015. Manufacturers of detergents are manufacturers, importers or downstream users within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01272/2008 and should therefore be given the possibility under this Regulation to adjust to that transition within a similar timeframe to that provided for in Regulation (EC) No\u00a01272/2008.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0648/2004 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0648/2004\nRegulation (EC) No\u00a0648/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the word \u2018preparation\u2019 or \u2018preparations\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(7), in its version of 30\u00a0December 2006, shall be replaced by \u2018mixture\u2019 or \u2018mixtures\u2019 respectively throughout the text;\n2. in paragraph\u00a01 of Article\u00a09, the introductory phrase shall be replaced by the following:\n3.
