Method of calculation and expression of energy value\nThe energy value of compound poultryfeed must be calculated in accordance with the formula set out below on the basis of the percentages of certain analytical components of the feed. This value is to be expressed in megajoules (MJ) of metabolizable energy (ME), nitrogen corrected, per kilogram of compound feed:\nMJ/kg of ME = 0,1551 \u00d7 % crude protein + 0,3431 \u00d7 % fat + 0,1669 \u00d7 % starch + 0,1301 \u00d7 % total sugar (expressed as sucrose)\n2. Tolerances applicable to declared values\nIf the official inspection provided for in Article 12 reveals a discrepancy (increased or reduced energy value of the feedingstuff) between the result of the inspection and the declared energy value, a minimum tolerance of 0,4 MJ/kg of ME shall be permitted.\n3. Expression of result\nAfter application of the above formula, the result obtained must be given to one decimal place.\n4. Sampling and analysis methods\nSampling of the compound feed and determination of the content of analytical components indicated in the method of calculation must be performed in accordance with the Community sampling methods and analysis methods for the official control of feedingstuffs respectively.\nThe following are to be applied:\n- for determining the crude fat content: method B, as amended by Commission Directive 84/4/EEC (1),\n- for determining the starch content: the polarimetric method set out in Commission Directive 72/199/EEC (2).\n(1) OJ No L 15, 18. 1. 1984, p. 28.\n(2) OJ No L 123, 29. 5. 1972, p. 6."}
