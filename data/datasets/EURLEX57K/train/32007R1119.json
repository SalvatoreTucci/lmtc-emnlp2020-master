Given the current market situation and with a view to avoid unnecessary administrative procedures and charges it is appropriate and found sufficient to have one single tender application period per month in the last quarter of 2007.\n(3) It is therefore necessary to derogate from Regulations (EC) No 581/2004 and (EC) No 582/2004.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 581/2004, the tendering periods for the months October to December 2007 shall be the following:\n(a) for October 2007 the tendering period shall begin on 9 and end on 16 October;\n(b) for November 2007 the tendering period shall begin on 6 and end on 13 November;\n(c) for December 2007 the tendering period shall begin on 4 and end on 11 December.\nIf the starting date is a public holiday, the period shall begin on the following working day.
