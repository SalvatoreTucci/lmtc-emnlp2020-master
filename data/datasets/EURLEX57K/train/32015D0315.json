Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.\n(2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.\n(3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept. As a result it may spread from one Member State to other Member States or to third countries through trade in live birds or their products.\n(4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC\u00a0(3) sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\n(5) Germany notified the Commission of two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in non-commercial holdings in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania where poultry are kept and it immediately took the measures required pursuant to Directive 2005/94/EC, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones, which should be defined in Parts A and B of the Annex to this Decision.\n(6) The Commission has examined those measures in collaboration with Germany, and it is satisfied that the borders of the protection and surveillance zones, established by the competent authority in that Member State, are at a sufficient distance to the actual holdings where the outbreaks were confirmed.\n(7) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to rapidly describe the protection and surveillance zones established in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in Germany at Union level.\n(8) Accordingly, the protection and surveillance zones in Germany, where the animal health control measures as laid down in Directive 2005/94/EC are applied, should be defined in this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Germany shall ensure that the protection and surveillance zones established in accordance with Article 16(1) of Directive 2005/94/EC comprise at least the areas listed in Parts A and B of the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0395, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza (OJ L\u00a010, 14.1.2006, p.\u00a016).\nANNEX\nPART A\nProtection zone as referred to in Article 1:\nISO Country Code Member State Code Name Date until applicable in accordance with Article\u00a029 of Directive 2005/94/EC\nDE Germany Postal code Area comprising: 16.2.2015\nMecklenburg-Western Pomerania\n17389 In the town of Anklam:\n\u2014 the town area of Anklam\n\u2014 the part Gellendin\n17390 In the municipality of Murchin the part Relzow\nPART B\nSurveillance zone as referred to in Article 1:\nISO Country Code Member State Code Name Date until applicable in accordance with Article\u00a031 of Directive 2005/94/EC\nDE Germany Postal code Area comprising: 25.2.2015\nMecklenburg-Western Pomerania\n17389 In the town of Anklam the parts:\n\u2014 Pelsin\n\u2014 Stretense\n17390 In the municipality of Gro\u00df Polzin the parts:\n\u2014 Gro\u00df Polzin\n\u2014 Klein Polzin\n\u2014 Konsages\n\u2014 Quilow\n17390 In the municipality of Klein B\u00fcnzow the parts:\n\u2014 Gro\u00df B\u00fcnzow\n\u2014 Klein B\u00fcnzow\n\u2014 Klitschendorf\n\u2014 Ramitzow\n\u2014 Salchow\n17390 In the municipality of Murchin the parts:\n\u2014 Johanneshof\n\u2014 Libnow\n\u2014 Murchin\n\u2014 Pinnow\n17390 In the municipality of Rubkow the parts:\n\u2014 B\u00f6mitz\n\u2014 Daugzin\n\u2014 Krenzow\n\u2014 Rubkow\n\u2014 Zarrentin\n17390 In the municipality of Ziethen the parts:\n\u2014 Jargelin\n\u2014 Menzlin\n\u2014 Ziethen\n17391 In the municipality of Medow the part Nerdin\n17391 Municipality of Postlow\n17391 In the municipality of Stolpe the parts:\n\u2014 Neuhof\n\u2014 Stolpe an der Peene\n17392 Municipality of Blesewitz\n17392 Municipality of Butzow\n17392 In the municipality of Neuenkirchen the parts:\n\u2014 M\u00fcggenburg\n\u2014 Neuenkirchen\n17392 In the municipality of Sarnow the part Panschow\n17398 Municipality of Bargischow\n17398 In the municipality of Bugewitz the parts:\n\u2014 Bugewitz\n\u2014 Kamp\n\u2014 Lucienhof\n\u2014 Rosenhagen\n17398 In the municipality of Ducherow the part Busow\n17398 Municipality of Neu-Kosenow\n17398 Municipality of Rossin\n17406 In the municipality of Usedom the parts:\n\u2014 K\u00f6lpin\n\u2014 Zecherin\n17440 In the municipality Buggenhagen the parts:\n\u2014 Klotzow\n\u2014 Wangelkow"}
