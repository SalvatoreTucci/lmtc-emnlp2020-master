FIELD OF APPLICATION\nThis method is applicable, after removal of non-fibrous matter, to binary mixtures of: 1.  polypropylene fibres (31)\nwith\n2. wool (1), animal hair (2 and 3), silk (4), cotton (5), acetate (17), cupro (19), modal (20), triacetate (22), viscose (23), acrylic (24), \"polyamide\" or \"nylon\" (28), polyester (29) and glass fibre (38).\n2.  PRINCIPLE\nThe polypropylene fibre is dissolved out from a known dry mass of the mixture with boiling xylene. The residue is collected, washed, dried and weighed ; its mass, corrected if necessary, is expressed as a percentage of the dry mass of the mixture. The percentage of polypropylene is found by difference.\n3. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS (other than those specified in the general instructions)      3.1. Apparatus        (i) Glass-stoppered conical flasks of at least 200 ml capacity.\n(ii) Reflux condenser (suitable for liquids of high boiling point), fitting the conical flasks (i).\n3.2. Reagent\nXylene distilling between 137 and 142\u00ba C.\nNote:\nThis reagent is highly flammable and has a toxic vapour. Suitable precautions must be taken in its use.\n4. TEST PROCEDURE\nFollow the procedure described in the general instructions, then proceed as follows:\nTo the specimen contained in the conical flask (3.1. (i)), add 100 ml of xylene (3.2) per gram of specimen. Attach the condenser (3.1. (ii)), bring the contents to the boil and maintain at boiling point for three minutes. Immediately decant the hot liquid through the weighed filter crucible (see note 1). Repeat this treatment twice more, each time using a fresh 50 ml portion of solvent.\nWash the residue remaining in the flask successively with 30 ml of boiling xylene (twice), then with 75 ml of light petroleum (I.3.2.1 of general instructions) (twice). After the second wash with light petroleum, filter the contents of the flask through the crucible, transfer any residual fibres to the crucible with the aid of a small quantity of light petroleum and allow the solvent to evaporate. Dry the crucible and residue, cool and weigh them.\nNotes:      1. The filter crucible through which the xylene is to be decanted must be pre-heated.\n2. After the treatment with boiling xylene, ensure that the flask containing the residue is cooled sufficiently before the light petroleum is introduced.\n3. In order to reduce the fire and toxicity hazards to the operator, a hot extraction apparatus using the appropriate procedures, giving identical results, may be used (1).\n5. CALCULATION AND EXPRESSION OF RESULTS\nCalculate the results as described in the general instructions. The value of d is 1 700.\n6. PRECISION\nOn a homogeneous mixture of textile materials, the confidence limits of results obtained by this method are not greater than \u00b1 1 for a confidence level of 95 %.\nMETHOD No 15  CHLOROFIBRES (HOMOPOLYMERS OF VINYL CHLORIDE) AND CERTAIN OTHER FIBRES  (Concentrated sulphuric acid method)\n1. FIELD OF APPLICATION\nThis method is applicable, after removal of non-fibrous matter, to binary mixtures of:   1.  chlorofibres (25) based on homopolymers of vinyl chloride (after-chlorinated or not)\nwith\n2. cotton (5), acetate (17), cupro (19), modal (20), triacetate (22), viscose (23), certain acrylics (24), certain modacrylics (27), \"polyamide\" or \"nylon\" (28) and polyester (29).\nThe modacrylics concerned are those which give a limpid solution when immersed in concentrated sulphuric acid (relative density 1 784 at 20\u00ba C).\nThis method can be used in place of Method Nos 8 and 9.\n2.  PRINCIPLE\nThe constituent other than the chlorofibre (i.e. the fibres mentioned under point 2 of paragraph 1) is dissolved out from a known dry mass of the mixture with concentrated suphuric acid (relative density 1 784 at 20\u00ba C). The residue, consisting of the chlorofibre, is collected, washed, dried and weighed ; its mass, corrected if necessary, is expressed as a percentage of the dry mass of the mixture. The percentage of the second constituent is obtained by difference.\n3. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS (other than those specified in the general instructions)      3.1. Apparatus        (i) Glass-stoppered conical flasks of at least 200 ml capacity.\n(ii) Glass rod with flattened end.\n(1) See for example the apparatus described in \"Melliand Textilberichte\" 56 (1975), pp. 643 to 645.           3.2. Reagents        (i) Sulphuric acid, concentrated (relative density 1 784 at 20\u00ba C).\n(ii) Sulphuric acid, approximately 50 % (m/m) aqueous solution.\nPrepare by adding carefully, while cooling, 400 ml of sulphuric acid (relative density 1 784 at 20\u00ba C) to 500 ml of distilled or de-ionized water. After cooling to room temperature, dilute the solution to one litre with water.\n(iii) Ammonia, dilute solution.\nDilute 60 ml of concentrated ammonia solution (relative density 0 7880 at 20\u00ba C) to one litre with distilled water.\n4. TEST PROCEDURE\nFollow the procedure described in the general instructions, then proceed as follows:\nTo the specimen contained in the flask (3.1. (i)) add 100 ml of sulphuric acid (3.2. (i)) per gram of specimen.\nAllow the contents of the flask to remain at room temperature for 10 minutes and during that time stir the test specimen occasionally by means of the glass rod. If a woven or knitted fabric is being treated, wedge it between the wall of the flask and the glass rod and exert a light pressure in order to separate the material dissolved by the sulphuric acid.\nDecant the liquid through the weighed filter crucible. Add to the flask a fresh portion of 100 ml of sulphuric acid (3.2. (i)) and repeat the same operation. Transfer the contents of the flask to the filter crucible and transfer the fibrous residue there with the aid of the glass rod. If necessary, add a little concentrated sulphuric acid (3.2. (i)) to the flask in order to remove any fibres adhering to the wall. Drain the filter crucible with suction ; remove the filtrate by emptying or changing the filter-flask, wash the residue in the crucible successively with 50 % sulphuric acid solution (3.2. (ii)), distilled or de-ionized water (I.3.2.3 of the general instructions, ammonia solution (3.2. (iii)) and finally wash thoroughly with distilled or de-ionized water, draining the crucible with suction after each addition. (Do not apply suction during the washing operation, but only after the liquid has drained off by gravity.)\nDry the crucible and residue, cool and weigh them.\n5. CALCULATION AND EXPRESSION OF RESULTS\nCalculate the results as described in the general instructions. The value of d is 1 700.\n6. PRECISION\nOn a homogeneous mixture of textile materials, the confidence limits of results obtained by this method are not greater than \u00b1 1 for a confidence level of 95 %."}
