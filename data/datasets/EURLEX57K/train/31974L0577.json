For the slaughter of animals belonging to the following species : bovine animals, swine, sheep, goats and solipeds, Member States shall ensure that suitable measures are taken to induce death as rapidly as possible after stunning, in accordance with appropriate procedures.\n2. For the purposes of this Directive, stunning means a process effected by a mechanically operated instrument, electricity, or gas anaesthesia without adverse effects on the condition of the meat or the offal, which when applied to an animal puts it into a state of insensibility which lasts until it is slaughtered, thus sparing it in any event all needless suffering.\nThis process must be approved by the competent authority.", "1. The competent authority in accordance with national legislation shall ensure that stunning is performed by means of equipment approved for the relevant species, that the equipment is in good working order and that it is used correctly by a person who has the necessary qualifications and knowledge.\n2. Should restraint prove to be necessary, this should take place immediately before stunning.
