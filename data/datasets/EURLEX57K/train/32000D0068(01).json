Consequently, equidae can only receive medical treatment with medicinal products containing pharmacologically active substances mentioned in Annexes I, II or III to that Regulation;\n(8) the Commission considers modifying Article 1 of Directive 81/851/EEC in order to introduce a definition of food-producing animals and to allow exemptions of certain groups of these species, if the animals included in such groups are sufficiently identified and controlled. Equidae clearly identified and specifically marked in their identification document as not intended for slaughter or intented for slaughter under controlled conditions in accordance with Community law qualify for such exemptions;\n(9) as its meeting of 9 to 11 November 1999 the Scientific Committee for Veterinary Medicinal products considered the Commission's request to indicate an appropriate general withdrawal period for substances not included in the annexes to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and recommended that this withdrawal period shall be at least six months.\n(10) the provisions of Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on conditions for the production and marketing of fresh meat(8), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(9), apply to meat from solipeds. In accordance with that Directive animals for slaughter must be identified so as to enable the competent authorities to determine their origin. Article 7(3) of Directive 90//426/EEC requires the official veterinarian at the slaughterhouse to record the identification number or identification document number of the slaughtered equidae;\n(11) in accordance with Directive 64/433/EEC the official veterinarian must, during the ante-mortem health inspection, pay attention to any signs that the animals have had substances with pharmacological effects administered to them or have consumed any other substances which may make their meat harmful to human health. The check of the medication record in the identification document shall therefore be part of this assessment;\n(12) the conditions for imports of equidae should be those laid down in Directive 90/426/EEC and in particular in Commission Decisions 93/196/EEC(10) and 93/197/EEC(11);\n(13) it is necessary to modify the identification document of registered equidae accordingly;\n(14) it is furthermore necessary to establish the identification document for equidae for breeding and production based on the identification document for registered equidae;\n(15) in order to allow the Member States time for the implementation of the proposed measures a transitional period should be provided for;\n(16) the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Zootechnics and the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 93/623/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
