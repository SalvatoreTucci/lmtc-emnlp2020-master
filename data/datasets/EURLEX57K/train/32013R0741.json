Pursuant to Decision 2012/735/EU, the Agreement is to be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion. The Agreement applies on a provisional basis from 1 August 2013.\n(2) Subsection 1 of Section B of Appendix 1 to Annex I to the Agreement concerns the tariff elimination schedule of the EU party for goods originating in Colombia. For a number of specific products, it provides for the application of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to open tariff quotas for such products.\n(3) The tariff quotas should be managed by the Commission on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(2).\n(4) Entitlement to benefit from the tariff concessions should be subject to the presentation of the relevant proof of origin to the customs authorities, as provided for in the Agreement.\n(5) Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\u00a0(3), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 927/2012\u00a0(4), contains new CN codes which are different from those referred to in the Agreement. The new codes should therefore be reflected in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since the Agreement takes effect on 1 August 2013, this Regulation should apply from the same date.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Union tariff quotas are opened for the goods originating in Colombia and listed in the Annex.", "The customs duties applicable to imports into the Union of goods originating in Colombia and listed in the Annex shall, within the respective tariff quota set out in the Annex to this Regulation, be suspended.", "The tariff quotas in the Annex shall be managed by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Articles 308a to 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 21.12.2012, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 304, 31.10.2012, p. 1.\nANNEX\nNotwithstanding the rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the wording of the description of the products is to be considered as having no more than an indicative value, the scope of the preferential scheme being determined, within the context of this Annex, by CN codes as they exist at the time of adoption of this Regulation.\nOrder No CN code Description of goods Quota period Annual quota volume\n09.7230 0201\u00a030 Meat of bovine animals, fresh, chilled or frozen, boneless From 1.8.2013 to 31.12.2013 2\u00a0334\nFrom 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12. 6\u00a0160\u00a0(1)\n09.7231 0711\u00a051 Mushrooms of the genus Agaricus, provisionally preserved, but unsuitable in that state for immediate consumption From 1.8.2013 to 31.12.2013 42\n2003\u00a010 Mushrooms of the genus Agaricus, prepared or preserved otherwise than by vinegar or acetic acid From 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12. 105\u00a0(2)\n09.7232 2208\u00a040\u00a051 Rum and other spirits obtained by distilling fermented sugar-cane products, in containers holding more than 2 litres From 1.8.2013 to 31.12.2013 625 hectolitres (expressed in equivalent pure alcohol)\nFrom 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12. 1\u00a0600 hectolitres (expressed in equivalent pure alcohol)\u00a0(3)\n09.7233 0710\u00a040 Sweetcorn From 1.8.2013 to 31.12.2013 84\n2008\u00a099\u00a085 Maize (corn), other than sweetcorn (Zea mays var. saccharata), otherwise prepared or preserved, not containing added spirit and added sugar From 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12. 210\u00a0(4)\n09.7234 0403\u00a010 Yogurt From 1.8.2013 to 31.12.2013 42\nFrom 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12. 105\u00a0(2)\n09.7235 1701\u00a013 Cane sugar, not containing added flavouring or colouring matter;
