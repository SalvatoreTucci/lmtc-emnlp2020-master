These programmes specify the objectives to be achieved, the measures carried out, their duration and their cost. Germany, the Netherlands and Slovenia have applied for the allocation of a Community financial contribution to these programmes within the time limit set out in Directive 2000/29/EC and in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 of 14 June 2002 establishing detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions relating to the allocation of a financial contribution from the Community for plant health control and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2051/97\u00a0(2).\n(3) The technical information provided by Germany, the Netherlands and Slovenia has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively and to conclude that the conditions for the granting of a Community financial contribution, as laid down in particular in Article 23 of Directive 2000/29/EC, have been met.
