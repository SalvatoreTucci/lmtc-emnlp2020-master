Objectives\nThe purpose of the accession partnership is to set out in a single framework the priority areas for further work identified in the Commission's opinion on Slovenia's application for membership of the European Union, the financial means available to help Slovenia implement these priorities and the conditions which will apply to that assistance. The accession partnership will provide a framework for a number of policy instruments which will be used to help the candidate countries in their preparations for membership. These will include inter alia the national programme for the adoption of the acquis to be adopted by Slovenia, the joint assessment of economic policy priorities, the pact against organised crime and the internal market road maps. Each of these instruments is different in nature and will be prepared and implemented according to specific procedures. They will not be an integral part of this partnership, but the priorities they contain will be compatible with it.\n2. Principles\nThe main priority areas identified for each candidate country relate to their ability to assume the obligations of meeting the Copenhagen criteria which state that membership requires:\n- that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities,\n- the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union,\n- the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.\nAt its meeting in Madrid, the European Council stressed the need for the candidate countries to adjust their administrative structures to ensure the harmonious operation of Community policies after accession and at Luxembourg, it stressed that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient; it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied.\n3. Priorities and intermediate objectives\nThe Commission's opinions and the Council's examination of these have highlighted the extent of the efforts which still have to be made in certain areas by the candidate countries to prepare for accession and took the view that none of these countries fully satisfies all of the Copenhagen criteria at the present time. This situation will require the definition of intermediate stages in terms of priorities, each to be accompanied by precise objectives to be set in collaboration with the countries concerned, the achievement of which will condition the degree of assistance granted and the progress of the negotiations under way with some countries and the opening of new negotiations with the others. The priorities and intermediate objectives have been divided into two groups - short and medium term. Those listed under the short-term have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Slovenia can complete or take them substantially forward by the end of 1998. In view of the short time span, and taking into account the administrative capacity required to achieve them, the number of priorities selected for the short term has been limited. The priorities listed under the medium term are expected to take more than one year to complete although work may and should also begin on them during 1998.\nSlovenia will be invited to draw up a national programme for the adoption of the acquis (NPAA) by the end of March which should set out a timetable for achieving these priorities and intermediate objectives and, where possible and relevant, indicate the necessary staff and financial resources.\nThe accession partnership will indicate that Slovenia will have to address all issues identified in the opinion. Incorporation of the acquis into legislation is not in itself sufficient; it will also be necessary to ensure that it is actually applied to the same standards as those which apply within the Union. In all of the areas listed below there is a need for credible and effective implementation and enforcement of the acquis.\nDrawing on the analysis of the Commission's opinion and the Council's examination of this, the following short- and medium-term priorities and intermediate objectives have been identified for Slovenia.\n3.1. Short-term (1998)\nEconomic reform: establishment of medium-term economic policy priorities and joint assessment within the framework of the Interim/Cooperation Agreement; action on market-driven restructuring in the enterprise, finance and banking sectors and preparation of pension reform.\nReinforcement of institutional and administrative capacity: in particular introduction of a civil service act, improvements in the areas of the judiciary, of land registration, phytosanitary and veterinary administration, particularly as regards facilities at the external borders, financial control and audit functions, institutional strengthening in the area of environment, begin to set up structures needed for regional and structural policy.\nInternal market: including alignment in the areas of indirect taxation, intellectual and industrial property, adoption of VAT law and preparation for implementation in 1999, standardisation and certification (conformity assessment), technical regulations, and of company legislation and liberalisation of capital movements (in particular currency legislation), establishment of a State aid monitoring authority, a first State aid inventory and the creation of a legal framework for State aid control, progress towards adoption of an anti-trust law.\nProperty law: further clarification of the situation pertaining to property legislation with particular regard to the right to purchase property for Union citizens.\nEnvironment: continue transposition of framework legislation, finalising the detailed approximation programmes and implementation strategies related to individual acts. Planning and commencement of implementation of these programmes and strategies.\n3.2. Medium-term\nPolitical criteria: pursue efforts to speed up property restitution.\nEconomic policy: regular review of the joint assessment of economic policy priorities, within the Europe Agreement framework, focusing on satisfying the Copenhagen criteria for membership of the Union and the acquis in the area of economic and monetary policy (coordination of economic policies, submission of convergence programmes, avoidance of excessive deficits); while Slovenia is not expected to adopt the euro immediately on accession, it is expected to pursue policies which aim to achieve real convergence in accordance with the Union's objectives of economic and social cohesion, and nominal convergence compatible with the ultimate goal of adoption of the euro.\nReinforcement of institutional and administrative capacity: as regards public procurement (in particular transparency), supervision of the insurance and security market, the Slovene Competition Office, completion of competition law, development and implementation of agricultural and regional policies, audiovisual policies, customs administration and enforcement of the customs code; improved operation of the judicial system; training for the judiciary in Community law and its application, reinforcement of justice and home affairs institutions (ensuring sufficient and properly trained personnel, in particular police, border guards, ministries and courts), strengthening of the nuclear safety authority, reform of customs and tax administrations to ensure readiness to apply the acquis, the reinforcement of food control administration.\nInternal market: including the alignment of legislation on public procurement, financial services, State aid (in particular alignment of monitoring rules and exclusive and special rights), upgrading of standardisation and conformity assessment structures, establishment of a market surveillance system and alignment of horizontal technical legislation on industrial products, increased efforts to liberalise the capital market and to facilitate foreign investments, further alignment of consumer protection, reinforcement of the competition office and the State aid monitoring authority, efficient enforcement of competition law, promotion of enterprise development, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alignment with the acquis in the fields of telecommunications, consumer protection and the internal energy market.\nJustice and home affairs: fight against organised crime (in particular money laundering, drugs and trafficking in human beings) and corruption, alignment of visa policy with that of the Union and completion of alignment on international conventions, implementation of migration policy and asylum procedures, notably in view of the Schengen acquis.\nNuclear safety: nuclear policy and investment plans to be adjusted in line with the results of the seismic risk assessment to be carried out in the surroundings of the Krsko NPP.\nAgriculture: establishment of a functioning land registry, strengthening of structural and rural development policy, including alignment with the agricultural acquis (including veterinary and phytosanitary matters, in particular external border controls), attention to environmental aspects of agriculture and biodiversity. Development of the capacity to implement and enforce the common agricultural policy (CAP), in particular the fundamental management mechanisms and administrative structures to monitor the agricultural markets and implement structural and rural development measures, adoption and implementation of the veterinary and phytosanitary requirements, upgrading of certain food-processing establishments and testing and diagnostic facilities, restructuring of the agri-food sector.\nFisheries: development of capacity to implement and enforce the common fisheries policy.\nTransport: further efforts on alignment with the acquis, in particular on road transport (market access, safety rules and taxation) and rail, and to provide necessary investment for transport infrastructure, notably extension of trans-European networks.\nEmployment and social affairs: development of appropriate labour-market structures and joint review of employment policies as preparation for participation in Union coordination; alignment of labour and occupational health and safety legislation and development of enforcement structures in particular early adoption of the framework directive on health and safety at work; enforcement of equal opportunities between women and men; further development of active, autonomous social dialogue; further development of social protection.\nEnvironment: including the development of monitoring and implementation control structures and capacities, continuous planning and implementation of approximation programmes related to individual legal acts. A particular emphasis should be given to air pollution, the waste water sector as well as integrated industrial pollution control and risk management. Environmental protection requirements and the need for sustainable development must be integrated into the definition and implementation of national, sectoral policies.\nRegional policy and cohesion: introduce the legal administrative and budgetary framework for a national policy to address regional disparities through an integrated approach, in order to participate in Union structural programmes after membership.\n4. Programming\nThe PHARE allocation for the period 1995 to 1997 has totalled ECU 72 million. Subject to the approval of the PHARE budget for the remaining period, the Commission will confirm the allocations for 1998 and 1999. Financial proposals will be submitted to the PHARE Management Committee as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89. Joint financing by the applicant countries will be systematically required for all investment projects. Financial assistance from the year 2000 onwards will comprise aid for agriculture and a structural instrument which will give priority to measures similar to the Cohesion Fund.\n5. Conditionality\nCommunity assistance will be conditional on respect by Slovenia of its commitments under the Europe Agreement, further steps towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and progress in implementing this accession partnership. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98.\n6. Monitoring\nThe implementation of the accession partnership will be monitored in the framework of the Europe Agreement. This will begin in 1998 before the Commission presents its first regular report to the Council reviewing the progress made by Slovenia including implementation of the accession partnership.\nThe relevant sections of the accession partnership will be discussed in the appropriate sub-committee. The Association Committee will discuss overall developments, progress and problems in meeting its priorities and intermediate objectives as well as more specific issues referred to it from the sub-committees. The Association Committee will report to the Association Council on the implementation of the accession partnership.\nThe PHARE Management Committee will ensure that financing decisions are compatible with the accession partnerships.\nThe accession partnership will be amended as necessary in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98. The Commission will propose, before the end of 1999 and at regular intervals thereafter, a review of this partnership, on which the Council will take a formal decision. These reviews will include consideration of the need to further specify intermediate objectives in the light of the progress made by Slovenia in meeting the objectives set out in this partnership."}
