Those provisional MRLs represent 96\u00a0% of the maximum daily intake of residues contained in food obtained from turkey.\n(7) Since the relevant data on depletion of sodium salicylate in eggs are not available, the CVMP could not evaluate the safety of substance in eggs. Sodium salicylate should therefore not be used in animals producing eggs for human consumption.\n(8) The entry for sodium salicylate in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the recommended provisional MRLs for sodium salicylate for turkey while excluding the use of the substance in animals producing eggs for human consumption. The provisional MRL set out in that Table for sodium salicylate should expire on 1 January 2015.\n(9) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 12 December 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 October 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 15, 20.1.2010, p. 1.\nANNEX\nThe entry Sodium salicylate in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 shall be replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic classification\n\u2018Sodium salicylate NOT APPLICABLE Bovine, porcine No MRL required NOT APPLICABLE For oral use.
