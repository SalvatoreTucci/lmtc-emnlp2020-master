In particular, Annex IXa provides that dimethyldicarbonate must be added prior to bottling. The translation of the term \u2018bottling\u2019 and its different meanings in certain languages have led to diverging interpretations of the scope of this provision by operators and control authorities.\n(2) Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 of 29 April 2002 laying down certain rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine sector products\u00a0(3) defines the term \u2018bottling\u2019 for its application.\n(3) To ensure a uniform interpretation of the requirements applicable to the use of dimethyldicarbonate, the definition of the term \u2018bottling\u2019 provided in Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 should be used to clarify the requirements contained in Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000. Annex IXa to Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["The first indent of the second paragraph of Annex IXa to Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 Addition must be carried out only a short time prior to bottling, defined as putting the product concerned up for commercial purposes in containers of a capacity not exceeding 60 litres.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 April 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
