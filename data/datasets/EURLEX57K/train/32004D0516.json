In some cases however, this rationalisation could involve extending certain particularly effective derogations to all Member States. The Commission\u2019s communication of 20 October 2003 reiterates this compromise.\n(7) The requested measure is to be considered first and foremost as a measure to prevent certain types of tax evasion in the ready-to-wear clothing industry.\n(8) The Kingdom of the Netherlands should be granted an extension for the current derogation until 31 December 2006 .\n(9) The derogation has no adverse impact on the European Communities\u2019 own resources accruing from VAT nor does it affect the amount of VAT charged at the final stage of consumption.\n(10) In order to ensure legal continuity, this Decision should apply as from 1 January 2004,", "main_body": ["Decision 98/20/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n\u2014 in Article 1 the date \u201831 December 2003\u2019 shall be replaced by \u201831 December 2006\u2019.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 14 June 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nB.
