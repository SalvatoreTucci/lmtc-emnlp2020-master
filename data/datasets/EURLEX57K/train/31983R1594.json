(2) OJ No L 162, 12.6.1982, p. 6.\nWhereas this Regulation is intended to replace Council Regulation (EEC) No 2114/71 of 28 September 1971 on the subsidy for oilseeds (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 851/78 (2),", "main_body": ["The subsidy provided for in Article 27 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC shall be granted, under the conditions laid down in that Article:    (a) for colza, rape and sunflower seeds processed in the Community for the production of oil;\n(b) for colza and rape seeds processed in the Community for incorporation into animal feedingstuffs.", "1. Member States shall control either at the oil mill the processing of colza, rape and sunflower seeds or at the feed mill the incorporation of colza and rape seeds to ensure that the subsidy is received only for seeds which qualify for it.\n2. Member States shall communicate to the other Member States and to the Commission the provisions adopted by them to ensure the control provided for in paragraph 1, before applying them.\nWhere these provisions are not such as to implement the aims referred to in that paragraph, the amendments which the Member State concerned is to make to them shall be decided in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC.", "The amount of the subsidy shall be that which is applicable on the day on which the Member State concerned takes over responsibility for control:    - at the oil mill in which the colza, rape and sunflower seeds are processed, or\n- at the feed mill in which the colza and rape seeds are incorporated.\nHowever, the amount of subsidy applicable on the day on which the application for the certificate referred to in Article 4 was lodged, adjusted in accordance with Article 7, shall be applied, at the request of the party concerned, to seeds placed under control at the oil mill or the feed mill during the period of validity of the certificate.", "A Community subsidy certificate shall be introduced which shall provide proof that the seeds harvested in the Community have been placed under control in an oil mill or a feed mill and which shall certify, where such is the case, that the amount of the subsidy has been fixed in advance.

(1) OJ No L 222, 2.10.1971, p. 2. (2) OJ No L 116, 28.4.1978, p. 4.\nThe certificate shall be issued on the day on which the Member State concerned becomes responsible for control:    - at the oil mill in which the colza, rape and sunflower seeds are processed, or\n- at the feed mill in which the colza and rape seeds are incorporated.", "1. When fixed in advance, the amount of the subsidy applicable on the day on which the application was lodged shall be adjusted on the basis of:    (a) the difference between the target price valid on that day and that valid on the day on which the seeds are placed under control at the oil mill or the feed mill, and\n(b) if necessary, a corrective amount.\n2. The corrective amount referred to in 1 (b) shall be calculated taking into account price trends for the seeds in question on the world market and also, where appropriate, the difference between the economic advantages accruing from processing these seeds and the economic advantages accruing from processing the main competing seeds.", "1. If the situation on the Community seed market is abnormal, and in particular if the volume of applications for advance fixing of the subsidy does not appear to be related to normal outlets for seeds harvested in the Community it may be decided, if the certificate referred to in Article 4 has not yet been issued, to alter the amount of the subsidy and to suspend the advance fixing of this amount, to the extent necessary to restore the balance between the Community market and the world market.\n2. The amount of the subsidy shall be altered by applying a corrective factor determined in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC.\n3. Suspension of advance fixing shall be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC.\nHowever, in case of emergency, the Commission may decide on this suspension ; in such case the period of suspension shall not exceed seven days.", "1. All imports of seeds referred to in Article 1, and mixtures of products falling within heading No 12.01 of the Common Customs Tariff containing at least 2 % by weight of one or more of these seeds, shall be subject to a system of control which shall apply until the seeds or mixtures are brought under the system of control provided for in Article 2, or, if they are not processed for the production of oil, or incorporated into feed, until the seeds are rendered ineligible for the subsidy.\n2. The control may be accompanied by the provision of a security, the level of which may not exceed the amount necessary to ensure that there is no incentive to withdraw imported seeds from control and to make an unwarranted application for the subsidy.", "0\n1. Entitlement to the subsidy shall be acquired:    (a) in the case of colza and rape and sunflower seeds for processing into oil, when they are so processed;\n(b) in the case of colza and rape seeds incorporated into animal feedingstuffs, when they are so incorporated;\n2. The subsidy shall be paid to the holder of the certificate, referred to in Article 4, in the Member State in which the seeds are placed under control:    - in the case of the seeds referred to in 1 (a), when proof of processing is furnished,\n- in the case of the seeds referred to in 1 (b), when proof of incorporation is furnished.\nHowever, the subsidy may be paid in advance as soon as the seeds have been placed under control, on condition that a security for their processing or incorporation is provided.", "1\n1. The weight of seeds referred to in Article 1 shall be determined, and samples taken, in particular:    - on import,\n- on entering the oil mill where the seeds will be processed,\n- on entering the feed mill in which the seeds are to be incorporated,\n- on being rendered ineligible for the subsidy in respect of quantities imported and intended for uses other than the production of oil or incorporation into animal feedingstuffs.\n2. The amount of the subsidy and the amount of the deposit referred to in Article 9 (2) shall be calculated on the basis of weight, this being adjusted in accordance with such differences as may exist between the recorded percentages of moisture and impurities and those used to define the standard quality for which the target price is fixed.", "2\nRegulation (EEC) No 2114/71 is hereby repealed with effect from 1 October 1983.", "3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 1983.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 14 June 1983.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nI.
