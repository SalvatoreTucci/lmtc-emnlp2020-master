It is therefore appropriate to adjust the aggregated data specified in the first table set out in Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 to include only those data that are strictly necessary for the implementation of that Regulation.\n(2) In order to improve the quality and accuracy of the monitoring of CO2 emissions from passenger cars, it is however necessary to specify further some of the required data parameters and add other parameters that have until now been monitored on a voluntary basis.\n(3) The inclusion of the type-approval number as a data parameter to be monitored and reported can improve the means for manufacturers to verify the provisional calculations of their average specific emissions and specific emissions targets and, as a consequence, ensure improved accuracy in the final dataset.\n(4) Passenger cars that are approved nationally in small series in accordance with Article 23 of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive)\u00a0(2) or cars individually approved in accordance with Article 24 of that Directive are not taken into account for the calculation of the average specific emissions of a manufacturer. It is however important to monitor the number of those vehicles in a consistent way in order to assess any potential impact on the monitoring process and the attainment of the Union\u2019s average CO2 emissions target. The aggregate numbers of those registrations should therefore be provided on an annual basis.\n(5) It should also be ensured that the monitoring of CO2 emissions from passenger cars is aligned with that for light commercial vehicles under Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 setting emission performance standards for light commercial vehicles as part of the Union\u2019s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles\u00a0(3) by including as mandatory monitoring parameters also the engine capacity and the electric energy consumption, in addition to the type-approval number. Moreover, where the certificate of conformity is not used as the primary data source and data is taken, inter alia, from type-approval documents, it should be clarified that the data in those cases should be consistent with the data provided in the certificates of conformity.\n(6) In order to ensure that those amendments can be taken into account for the monitoring of the data in 2013, it is appropriate to provide for an entry into force not later than the seventh day following that of the publication of this act in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 April 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 145, 31.5.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ANNEX II\nMONITORING AND REPORTING EMISSIONS\nPART A \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of data on new passenger cars and determination of CO2 monitoring information\n1.

Where both a minimum value and a maximum value are specified for the mass or footprint values referred to in point 1(i) for a passenger car, Member States shall use only the maximum figure for the purposes of this Regulation.
