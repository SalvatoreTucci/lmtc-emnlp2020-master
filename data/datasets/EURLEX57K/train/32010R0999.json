That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the enzyme preparation 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 17594) as a feed additive for sows, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 17594) has been authorised for weaned piglets, pigs for fattening, poultry for fattening and poultry for laying by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1088/2009\u00a0(2).\n(5) New data were submitted to support the application. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 25 May 2010\u00a0(3) that 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 17594), under the proposed conditions of use, does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that its use can improve the digestibility of phosphorus. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 17594) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 13.11.2009, p. 6.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8(6):1634.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
