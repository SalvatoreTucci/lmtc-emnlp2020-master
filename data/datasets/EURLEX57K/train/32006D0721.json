In that report it came to the conclusion that the proposed uses for lycopene from Blakeslea trispora are safe for human consumption.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 27 April 2004.\n(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.\n(5) Consequently, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on 22 November 2004.\n(6) On 21 April 2005 EFSA adopted the \u2018Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies on a request from the Commission related to an application on the use of \u03b1-tocopherol-containing oil suspension of lycopene from Blakeslea trispora as a novel food ingredient\u2019.\n(7) The opinion came to the conclusion that the requested levels of use of lycopene from Blakeslea trispora would lead to an additional intake of up to about 2 mg/day. It also concluded that this additional intake was not of concern from the safety point of view.\n(8) Food additives falling within the scope of Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption\u00a0(2), are excluded from the scope of Regulation (EC) No 258/97. This Decision does therefore not constitute authorisation to use lycopene from Blakeslea trispora as a food colour.\n(9) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that lycopene from Blakeslea trispora in an \u03b1-tocopherol containing suspension complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Lycopene from Blakeslea trispora as specified in Annex I, may be placed on the market in the Community as a novel food ingredient for use in foods as specified in Annex II.", "The designation \u2018lycopene\u2019 shall be displayed in the list of ingredients of foodstuffs containing it or, if there is no list of ingredients, on the labelling of the product as such.", "Vitatene Antibiotics SAU shall submit to the Commission, at the end of three years following the adoption of this Decision, data as to the groups of foods with lycopene from Blakeslea trispora that have been placed on the market in the EU and the corresponding use levels of this lycopene.", "This Decision is addressed to Vitatene Antibiotics SAU, Avd. de Antibioticos, 59-61, 24080 Leon, Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.
