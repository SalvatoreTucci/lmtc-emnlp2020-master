In particular, the Convention ensures the necessary legal certainty for the parties that their choice of court agreement will be respected and that a judgment given by the chosen court will be capable of recognition and enforcement in international cases.\n(3) Article 29 of the Convention allows Regional Economic Integration Organisations such as the European Union to sign, accept, approve or accede to the Convention. The Union signed the Convention on 1 April 2009, subject to its conclusion at a later date, in accordance with Council Decision 2009/397/EC\u00a0(1).\n(4) The Convention affects Union secondary legislation relating to jurisdiction based on the choice of the parties and to the recognition and enforcement of the resulting judgments, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a044/2001\u00a0(2), which is to be replaced as of 10 January 2015 by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3).\n(5) With the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 the Union paved the way for the approval of the Convention, on behalf of the Union, by ensuring coherence between the rules of the Union on the choice of court in civil and commercial matters and the rules of the Convention.\n(6) When signing the Convention, the Union declared under Article 30 of the Convention that it exercises competence over all the matters governed by the Convention. Consequently, the Member States shall be bound by the Convention by virtue of its approval by the Union.\n(7) The Union should, when approving the Convention, in addition make the declaration allowed under Article 21 excluding from the scope of the Convention insurance contracts in general, subject to certain well-defined exceptions. The objective of the declaration is to preserve the protective jurisdiction rules available to the policyholder, the insured party or a beneficiary in matters relating to insurance under Regulation (EC) No 44/2001. The exclusion should be limited to what is necessary to protect the interests of the weaker parties in insurance contracts. It should therefore not cover reinsurance contracts nor contracts relating to large risks. The Union should at the same time make a unilateral declaration stating that it may, at a later stage in light of the experience acquired in the application of the Convention, reassess the need to maintain its declaration under Article 21.\n(8) The United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 and are therefore taking part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n(9) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application,", "main_body": ["The Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (\u2018the Convention\u2019) is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union\u00a0(4).", "The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person(s) empowered to deposit, on behalf of the Union, the instrument of approval provided for in Article 27(4) of the Convention.\nThe deposit of the instrument of approval referred to in the first subparagraph shall take place within one month of 5\u00a0June 2015\u00a0(5).", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When depositing the instrument of approval provided for in Article 27(4) of the Convention, the Union shall, in accordance with Article 21 of the Convention, make a declaration relating to insurance contracts.\nThe text of that declaration is attached as Annex I to this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When depositing the instrument of approval provided for in Article 27(4) of the Convention, the Union shall make a unilateral declaration.\nThe text of that declaration is attached as Annex II to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 December 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
