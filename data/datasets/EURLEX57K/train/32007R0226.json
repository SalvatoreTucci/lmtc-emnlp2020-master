That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(3) The application concerns a new use of the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20, Levucell SC10 ME), as a feed additive for dairy goats and dairy sheep, to be classified in the additive category \u2018Zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 was authorised without a time limit for dairy cows and cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005\u00a0(2).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for dairy goats and dairy sheep. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 15 June 2006 that Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20, Levucell SC10 ME) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. It further concluded that Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20, Levucell SC10 ME) does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of the preparation does not have an adverse effect on these additional animal categories. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
