Some of these deficiencies have been addressed by Brazil, but recent Commission missions have nonetheless identified serious instances of non-compliance with regard to holding registration, animal identification and movement control and a failure to respect their previous commitments to take the appropriate corrective measures.\n(3) It is only possible to allow imports to continue on a secure basis by strengthtening the control and surveillance of holdings from which animals eligible for export to the Community are sourced and by establishing a provisional list of such approved holdings drawn up by Brazil, for which guarantees are provided that they fully meet requirements for imports of fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat to the Community, which are audited and inspected and for which full reports of audits and inspections are made available to the Commission.\n(4) The Commission services carry out inspections in the framework of the Food and Veterinary Office operations in third countries in order to verify that the European Union import requirements are met in the listed holdings.\n(5) The provisional list of holdings may be reviewed after informing the Commission in the light of the outcome of these inspections. That list of approved holdings should be made publicly available through the Commission integrated computerised veterinary system Traces for information purposes.\n(6) It is necessary to provide in the list of third countries allowed to export fresh meat to the Community in Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC that only fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat obtained from animals slaughtered after the date of entry into force of this Decision may be accepted for import into the Community, as only with regards to such meat the new requirements concerning approved holdings can be guaranteed. At the same time it is opportune to correct an error in that table.\n(7) The list of third countries in Part 1 of Annex II and the certificate model \u2018BOV\u2019 in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) In order to avoid disruption of trade, consignments of fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat certified and dispatched before the entry into force of this Decision should be allowed for import into the Community for a specified period.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In the list of third countries laid down in Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC, the line of the territory \u2018BR-Brazil\u2019 is replaced by the following:\nBR \u2014 Brazil \u2018BR-0 Whole country EQU\nBR-1 Part of the State of Minas Gerais (except regional delegations of Oliveira, Passos, S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo de Sapucai, Setelagoas and Bambu\u00ed);\n\u2014 Cuiaba (except for the municipalities of San Antonio de Leverger, Nossa Senhora do Livramento, Pocone and Bar\u00e3o de Melga\u00e7o),\n\u2014 Caceres (except for the municipality of Caceres),\n\u2014 Lucas do Rio Verde,\n\u2014 Rondonopolis (except for the municipality of Itiquiora),\n\u2014 Barra do Gar\u00e7a,\n\u2014 Barra do Burgres.\nBR-2 State of Santa Catarina BOV A and H 1  31 January 2008\u2019", "In the \u2018BOV\u2019 veterinary certificate laid down in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC:\n1.
