This Regulation seeks to optimise the use of parking places and to facilitate drivers\u2019 or transport companies\u2019 decisions about when and where to park by means of deployment of information services.\n(3) The Council resolution\u00a0(2) on combating and preventing road freight crime and providing secure truck parks highlights the need to improve safety and security for truck drivers and parking possibilities.\n(4) Mandatory rest periods and breaks may have an influence on drivers\u2019 behaviour with regard to choosing a parking place. The present Regulation seeks to optimise the use of parking places and to facilitate drivers\u2019 or transport companies\u2019 decisions on when and where to park by means of deployment of information services.\n(5) In order to ensure the interoperability and continuity of the service throughout the Union as well as to take full account of data protection requirements, it is important that all Member States develop a harmonised and seamless approach towards the provision of information services for safe and secure parking places for trucks and commercial vehicles across the Union. To this effect, Member States can rely on technical solutions and standards, which shall be provided mainly through European and/or international standardisation organisations and/or associations, in order to ensure interoperability and continuity of the service EU-wide while also taking full account of data protection requirements.\n(6) The provision of security and comfort information contributes to the decision drivers make in choosing the parking area. Guidance may be given by displaying the security, safety and services features offered on a parking.\n(7) In case of specific persistent heavy demand for safe and secure parking in certain areas, truck drivers should be redirected from a full parking area to another location in the priority zone where free safe and secure places are available in order to avoid unsuitable parking. Therefore, Member States should determine the \u2018priority zones\u2019.\n(8) If static signs are used to indicate safe and secure parking areas, these should comply with the Vienna Convention of 8 November 1968, where Member States are party to it.\n(9) Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the reuse of public sector information\u00a0(3) (PSI) sets minimum rules for reusing PSI throughout the European Union. It is built around two key pillars of the internal market, namely transparency and fair competition, and encourages Member States to go beyond these minimum rules for the reuse of public sector information and to adopt policies allowing broad use of documents, or data in the context of this Regulation, held by public sector bodies. In some cases the reuse of data will take place without a licence being agreed. In other cases a licence will be issued imposing conditions on the reuse by the licensee and dealing with issues such as liability, the proper use of data, guaranteeing accordance with data protection requirements, non-alteration and the acknowledgement of source. The intellectual property rights of third parties shall not be affected.\n(10) Feedback from the users is information that is provided by the parking users in order to give personal and anonymous advice to other future users and to truck parking area operators. This information may be used for a quality management check of the information service as well as for the assessment. The anonymity of the feedback should be guaranteed.\n(11) The deployment and use of ITS applications and services might entail the processing of personal data which should be carried out in accordance with Union law, as set out, in particular, in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(4) and in Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)\u00a0(5). Therefore, principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation should be applied to ITS applications.\n(12) The deployment and use of ITS applications and services, as set out in specifications adopted in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 2010/40/EU, are addressed in accordance with Union law, including in particular Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products\u00a0(6) as well as relevant national legislation.\n(13) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation establishes the specifications necessary to ensure compatibility, interoperability and continuity for the deployment and operational use of information services for safe and secure parking places for trucks and commercial vehicles on a Union level in accordance with Directive 2010/40/EU.\nIt shall apply to the provision of information services situated on the trans-European road network (TERN).", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018safe and secure parking place\u2019 means a parking place for commercial users allowing them to avoid unsuitable parking and contributing to safety of drivers and freight;\n(2) \u2018user\u2019 means any truck or commercial vehicle driver, dispatcher, haulier, traffic management body, or any other body such as cargo owners, insurance companies, road authorities, and police forces.
