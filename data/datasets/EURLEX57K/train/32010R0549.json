It is necessary to set the representative period for the closing of public intervention for beef through a tendering procedure and, therefore, to reflect this power of the Commission in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009\u00a0(2).\n(2) In Article 29(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009, differing and erroneous provisions have been adopted in the different language versions as regards the rules to be applied when the storage place indicated by the offerer or tenderer is changed by the intervention agency. As a consequence, it is necessary to clarify that in that case the additional transport costs shall be borne by the intervention agencies, except for the first 20\u00a0km, and to add that where Article 38(3) applies, the reduction shall not exceed the transport costs beyond 100\u00a0km.\n(3) Part IX of Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 lays down provisions related to cartons for the packaging of beef bought into intervention. It is necessary to adapt the sealing requirements provided for in point 6 in order to align them to the requirements in Section I of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin\u00a0(3).\n(4) At the occasion of this amendment of Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 it is appropriate to correct an omission in Article 25 of that Regulation.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 is amended as follows:\n1.
