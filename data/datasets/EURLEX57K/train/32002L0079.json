It is necessary to take into account relevant data obtained both from authorised pesticide use and from supervised trials and animal feeding studies.\n(4) The information available has been reviewed. For many pesticide/agricultural product combinations the data is sufficient to allow the calculation of a maximum residue level at which residues of the pesticide concerned may be considered safe for human health. Where this level exceeds the lower limit of analytical determination it is appropriate to fix the maximum residue level at the level calculated. For some combinations the information available is inadequate and it is appropriate to fix maximum residue levels at the lower limit of analytical determination. For other positions the information is adequate but demonstrates that the setting of a maximum residue level above the lower limit of analytical determination may give rise to an unacceptable, acute or chronic exposure of the consumer to the residues. In such cases, it is appropriate to fix maximum residue levels at the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(5) The lifetime exposure and the acute exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the Community procedures and practices taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(7). For abamectin, maximum residue limits have been established in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1752/2002(9) resulting from the use of veterinary medicinal products containing the same substance for the treatment of food-producing animal species (Commission Regulation (EC) No 3425/93(10). These uses and the evaluation of the acceptable daily intake provided by the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products on which these maximum residue limits were based were taken into account. It has been concluded that the maximum residue levels proposed in this Directive do not lead to the acceptable daily intakes being exceeded or to acute toxic effects.\n(6) To ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set maximum residue levels at the lower limit of analytical determination for all such products covered by Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC.\n(7) Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The Community's trading partners have been consulted about the levels proposed in this Directive through the World Trade Organisation, and their comments on these levels have been considered.\n(9) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, and in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food crops treated with plant protection products, have been taken into account(11).\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC, the entry relating to \"bromopropylate\" is deleted.", "In part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC the maximum pesticide residue levels for abamectin, azocyclotin and cyhexatin, bifenthrin, bitertanol, bromopropylate, clofentezine, cyromazine, fenpropimorph, flucytrinate, hexaconazole, metacrifos, myclobutanil, penconazole, prochloraz, profenofos, resmethrin and bioresmethrin, tridemorph, triadimefon and triadimenol listed in Annex I to the present Directive are added.", "Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC is amended as follows:\n(a) in part A maximum pesticide residue levels for abamectin, bifenthrin, bitertanol, bromopropylate, cyromazine, flucytrinate, metacrifos, penconazole, prochloraz, profenofos, resmethrin and bioresmethrin, tridemorph, triadimefon and triadimenol, listed in Annex II to the present Directive are added;\n(b) in part B the maximum pesticide residue levels for azocyclotin and cyhexatin, fenpropimorph, clofentezine and myclobutanil, listed in Annex III to the present Directive are added.", "Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC is amended as follows:\n(a) the maximum pesticide residue levels for abamectin, azocyclotin and cyhexatin, bifenthrin, bitertanol, bromopropylate, clofentezine, cyromazine, fenpropimorph, flucytrinate, hexaconazol, metacrifos, myclobutanil, penconazole, prochloraz, profenofos, resmethrin and bioresmethrin, tridemorph, triadimefon and triadimenol, listed in Annex IV to the present Directive are added;\n(b) the maximum pesticide residue level for ethion in tea is replaced by 3 mg/kg.", "1.
