That aid is granted for the human consumption of locally produced fresh cows' milk products, within the limits of the consumption needs of Madeira as assessed periodically. That Article also allows the production in Madeira, for local consumption, of UHT milk reconstituted from milk powder originating in the Community, in so far as this measure ensures that locally produced milk is collected and finds outlets.\n(2) It is estimated that the consumption needs of Madeira will not exceed the limit of 4000 tonnes which corresponds to the limit of local production within which the additional levy scheme applicable to producers of cows' milk provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 of 28 December 1992 establishing an additional levy in the milk and milk products sector(2), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 582/2002(3), does not apply to Madeira. As a result, the volume of milk for which the aid provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 paid to dairies for all products resulting from the processing of milk produced locally should be limited to a quantity of 4000 tonnes.\n(3) Rules should also be laid down on the use of fresh cows' milk produced in Madeira for which the aid for human consumption is granted and the minimum volume that must be incorporated into reconstituted UHT milk intended for local consumption. A minimum volume of incorporation of 15 % is appropriate to ensure that locally produced milk is collected and finds outlets.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2234/92(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1802/95(5), must therefore be amended.\n(5) Provisions on the amount of the aid and eligible products are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001. This Regulation should therefore apply from the date of entry into force of that Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2234/92 is amended as follows:\n1.
