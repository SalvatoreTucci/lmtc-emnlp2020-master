Over a five-year period starting on 1 January 1999, an aerial-survey project shall be implemented at Community level in agricultural statistics. The use of remote-sensing shall also be continued, in particular with the agrometeorological system being made operational.\n2. Taking into account data already collected by the Member States, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be designed, at Community level and if possible in areas of interest to the Community, more specifically to:\n- collect data needed to implement and monitor the common agricultural policy and analyse interactions between agriculture, the environment and the countryside,\n- provide estimates of the areas under the principal crops,\n- ensure that the condition of crops is monitored until harvesting, so as to enable early estimates of yields and production to be made.\n3. After a three-year period starting on 1 January 1999, it shall be decided, in the light of experience and under the procedure laid down in Article 5(2), whether to continue with the measures, amend them for the remaining two years or terminate them.", "The Commission shall ensure that these measures are implemented within available funding limits.\nNational bodies responsible for the production of agricultural statistics or bodies recognised by them may be involved on a voluntary basis in the implementation of these measures.\nIn accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5(2), the Commission shall report annually to the Member States on the implementing arrangements, the methods used, the utilisation of appropriations, the evaluation of the results and the work programme for the following year.", "The financial framework for the implementation of this programme for the period 1999 to 2003 is hereby set at EUR 12,5 million.\nThe annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective.", "The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision shall be adopted in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 5(2).", "1.
