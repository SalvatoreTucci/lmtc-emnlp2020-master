These are established in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007\u00a0(2). The scope of those rules was limited to the stocks which were subject to cooperation with Norway and the Faeroe Islands. However, the zones corresponding to the southern component of mackerel and horse mackerel, as well as other zones subject to catch limitations were not covered. It is appropriate to extend the scope of those rules to all zones where catch limitations are established and where the conservation status of the stocks and the need to ensure effective control so require.\n(2) According to Article 9 paragraph 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007, a weighing logbook is to be kept by the party weighing the fish, but there is no indication as to the time-frame for complying with this obligation. In order to avoid any uncertainty in the interpretation of this provision, a clear deadline for the completion of the logbook should be specified.\n(3) According to Article 9 paragraph 3(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007, each tanker load used to transport fish from the quayside to the processing plant is to be weighed and recorded separately. However, to avoid undue delay to the discharge of the cargo, it should be made possible to only record the total weight of all tanker loads from the same vessel provided that these tanker loads are weighed consecutively and without interruption.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) Article 60 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy\u00a0(3) establishes the general rules for the weighing of fisheries products and empowers the Commission to adopt detailed rules for its application. Considering that this Article will only apply from 1 January 2011 and having regard to the urgency for the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007 to apply during the 2010 fishing season, it is appropriate to make use of Article 5(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2847/93 as legal basis for this amendment.\n(6) The Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
