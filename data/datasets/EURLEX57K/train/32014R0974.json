Alternatively, the use of a digital refractometer is permitted.\nThis apparatus must enable the percentage weight of sucrose to be determined to the nearest\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00,1 %.\nThe refractometer must be calibrated at 20\u00a0\u00b0C by a system that enables the temperature of measurement cell to be adjusted from +\u00a015\u00a0\u00b0C to +\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C with an accuracy of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00,5\u00a0\u00b0C.\nOperating instructions for this apparatus, and in particular those dealing with calibration and light source, must be strictly followed.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0METHOD\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preparation of the sample\n3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Liquid products\nMix carefully and proceed to determination.\n3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Semi-dense products, pur\u00e9es, fruit juices with matter in suspension\nCarefully mix an average laboratory sample and then homogenize.\nStrain a part of the sample through dry gauze folded in four, remove the first drops and proceed to the determination on the filtrate.\n3.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dense products (jams and jellies)\nIf the previously homogenized product cannot be used directly, weigh 40 g of the product to the nearest 0,01\u00a0g in a 250 ml beaker and add 100 ml of distilled water.\nBoil gently for two or three minutes, stirring with a glass rod.\nCool, pour the contents of the beaker into an appropriate tared vessel using distilled water as a flushing liquid, add distilled water so as to obtain about 200 g of product, weigh it to the nearest 0,01\u00a0g, and mix the solution thoroughly.\nAllow to stand for 20 minutes, then strain through a folded filter or a B\u00fcchner funnel.
