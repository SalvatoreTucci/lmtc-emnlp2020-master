It is also part of a policy of subsidiarity, allowing for decisions to be adopted on many domains at the appropriate level. The possibility of regional differentiation offers regions an additional incentive to improve the quality of their administration in a transparent fashion. The reductions should be linked to the socioeconomic conditions of the regions in which they are applied.\n(3) Derogations cannot be authorised for indefinite periods. Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC restricts the duration of further exemptions or reductions of taxation applicable to energy and electricity products to six years with the possibility of renewal.\n(4) The low level of differentiation of the excise rates between regions and the differences in retail prices among distribution networks imply that the risk of traffic detours and, consequently, the risk of an increase in environmentally damaging emissions will be very low. This will also meet the needs of the energy policy.\n(5) The intra-Community commercial movement of diesel and unleaded petrol takes place almost completely under duty suspension arrangements. This form of intra-Community movement is not affected by the devolution of excise duties contemplated by France. For the very limited number of cases where commercial movement takes place under duty-paid arrangements, the planned procedures of control are of a non-discriminatory nature and, subject to a regular review of their practicalities, without real impact on the intra-Community movement of duty-paid products. Under these conditions, the decentralisation of excise duties does not seem to hinder the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(6) The very tight limits set for the differentiation of duty rates between regions should ensure that the decentralisation of excise duties will not distort competition on the oil products market. Moreover, the differentiation should be compensated by the large price differences among distribution networks. As the requested measure does not apply to commercial diesel, any distortion of competition on the freight and passenger transport markets should be excluded.\n(7) The increase in national rates which will precede the possibility of regional reductions in rates leads to the conclusion that the application of the French measure should not in principle result in any hindrance to Community policy on environmental protection.\n(8) The Commission regularly reviews reductions and exemptions to check that they do not distort competition or hinder the operation of the internal market and are not incompatible with Community policy on protection of the environment, energy and transport,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0France is hereby authorised to apply reduced levels of taxation to unleaded petrol and gas oil used as fuel.
