SCOPE AND CHOICE OF METHOD\nSubject to the consent of their competent authorities, credit institutions may choose one of the methods set out below to measure the risks associated with the transactions listed in Annex III. Interest-rate and foreign-exchange contracts traded on recognized exchanges where they are subject to daily margin requirements and foreign-exchange contracts with an original maturity of fourteen calendar days or less are excluded.\n2. METHODS\nMethod 1: the \"mark-to-market\" approach\nStep (a): by attaching current market values to contracts (mark to market) the current replacement cost of all contracts with positive values is obtained.\nStep (b): to obtain a figure for the potential future credit exposure (1), the notional principal amounts or underlying values are multiplied by the following percentages:\n>TABLE>\nStep (c): the sum of the current replacement cost and the potential future credit exposure is multiplied by the risk weightings allocated to the relevant counterparties in Article 6.\nMethod 2: the \"original exposure\" approach\nStep (a): the notional principal amount of each instrument is multiplied by the percentages given below:\n>TABLE>\nStep (b): the original exposure thus obtained is multiplied by the risk weightings allocated to the relevant counterparties in Article 6.\n(1) Except in the case of single-currency \"floating/floating\" interest-rate swaps in which only the current replacement cost will be calculated.\n3. CONTRACTUAL NETTING (CONTRACTS FOR NOVATION AND OTHER NETTING AGREEMENTS)\n(a) Types of netting that the competent authorities may recognize\nFor the purposes of this point 3 \"counterparty\" means any entity (including natural persons) that has the power to conclude a contractual netting agreement.\nThe competent authorities may recognize as risk-reducing the following types of contractual netting:\n(i) bilateral contracts for novation between a credit institution and its counterparty under which mutual claims and obligations are automatically amalgamated in such a way that this novation fixes one single net amount each time novation applies and thus creates a legally binding, single new contract extinguishing former contracts;\n(ii) other bilateral netting agreements between a credit institution and its counterparty.\n(b) Conditions for recognition\nThe competent authorities may recognize contractual netting as risk-reducing only under the following conditions:\n(i) a credit institution must have a contractual netting agreement with its counterparty which creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that, in the event of a counterparty's failure to perform owing to default, bankruptcy, liquidation or any other similar circumstance, the credit institution would have a claim to receive or an obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions;\n(ii) a credit institution must have made available to the competent authorities written and reasoned legal opinions to the effect that, in the event of a legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would, in the cases described under (i), find that the credit institution's claims and obligations would be limited to the net sum, as described in (i), under:\n- the law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated and, if a foreign branch of an undertaking is involved, also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located,\n- the law that governs the individual transactions included, and\n- the law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the contractual netting;\n(iii) a credit institution must have procedures in place to ensure that the legal validity of its contractual netting is kept under review in the light of possible changes in the relevant laws.\nThe competent authorities must be satisfied, if necessary after consulting the other competent authorities concerned, that the contractual netting is legally valid under the law of each of the relevant jurisdictions. If any of the competent authorities is not satisfied in that respect, the contractual netting agreement will not be recognized as risk-reducing for either of the counterparties.\nThe competent authorities may accept reasoned legal opinions drawn up by types of contractual netting.\nNo contract containing a provision which permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor (a \"walkaway\" clause), may be recognized as risk-reducing.\n(c) Effects of recognition\n(i) Contracts for novation\nThe single net amounts fixed by contracts for novation, rather than the gross amounts involved, may be weighted. Thus, in the application of Method 1, in\n- Step (a): the current replacement cost, and in\n- Step (b): the notional principal amounts or underlying values\nmay be obtained taking account of the contract for novation. In the application of Method 2, in Step (a) the notional principal amount may be calculated taking account of the contract for novation; the percentages of Table 2 must apply.\n(ii) Other netting agreements\nIn the application of Method 1, in Step (a) the current replacement cost for the contracts included in a netting agreement may be obtained by taking account of the current hypothetical net replacement cost which results from the agreement. In Step (b) the single net amounts may be taken into account only for forward foreign-exchange contracts and other similar contracts, in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, in cases where the amounts to be claimed or delivered fall due on the same value date and in the same currency.\nIn the application of Method 2, in Step (a)\n- for forward foreign-exchange contracts and other similar contracts, in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, in cases where the amounts to be claimed or delivered fall due on the same value date and in the same currency, the notional principal amount may be calculated taking account of the netting agreement; to all these contracts Table 2 must apply,\n- for all other contracts included in a netting agreement, the percentages applicable may be reduced as indicated in Table 3:\n>TABLE>\n`"}
