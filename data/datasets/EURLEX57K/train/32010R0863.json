Experience has shown that in the case of certain destinations it may take longer to obtain all necessary documents. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the possibility to extend the deadline in such cases.\n(4) Where the deadline to submit proofs of export to the competent authority of the Member State is extended, the deadline for the Member State to notify the total levy to be paid by manufacturers and the deadline for manufacturers to pay the levy should also be adjusted. Similarly, the deadline fixed for Member States to establish and communicate to the Commission the surplus quantities should be modified.\n(5) Articles 3, 4 and 19 of Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 3(2) the following second subparagraph is added:\n2. in Article 4(3) the following second subparagraph is added:\n3.
