Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\n(5) All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(6) By a letter of 27 June 2013 to the Commission, the complainant formally withdrew its complaint.\n(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(8) The investigation has not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would be against the Union interest. Therefore the Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given an opportunity to comment. However, the Commission received no comments which would justify that such a termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings, whether or not finished, originating in the PRC and in Taiwan should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings, whether or not finished, originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China and Taiwan, currently falling within CN codes 7307\u00a023\u00a010 and 7307\u00a023\u00a090, is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 August 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 342, 10.11.2012, p. 2."}
