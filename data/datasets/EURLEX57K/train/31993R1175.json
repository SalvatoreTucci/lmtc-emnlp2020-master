whereas the aim of all the parties was to bring the EEA Agreement and the Bilateral Agreements on agriculture into force at the same time;\nWhereas, as a result of the postponement of the entry into force of the EEA Agreement following Switzerland's decision not to ratify it, Agreements in the form of exchanges of letters were signed on 17 March 1993 between the Community and, respectively,  Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden with the aim of bringing forward implementation of the bilateral agreements on agriculture with these countries for the period running from 15 April until 31 December 1993;\nWhereas the Council has approved, by the Decision of 15 March 1993 (1), the said Agreements;\nWhereas on the basis of the arrangements annexed to the Bilateral Agreements on agriculture concluded between the Community of the one part and Austria, Norway and Sweden, respectively, of the other part, which were signed on 2 May 1992, the Community  is to open annual reduced-duty and zero-duty tariff quotas for certain agricultural products originating in the abovementioned countries; whereas under Annex III to the arrangement between the Community and Austria, imports into Portugal of wine  originating in Austria are subject to duties equal to those applied by Portugal to imports from the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;\nWhereas the provisions annexed to the arrangements concerned provide that, should the date of entry into force of the said arrangements not coincide with the beginning of the calendar year, the provisions concerning the opening of tariff quotas shall be  applied on a pro rata basis for the first year; whereas it is advisable in the interests of clarity to group together all the agricultural products which benefit from tariff quotas in Annex I to this Regulation according to their place of origin,  specifying for each product the volume of tariff quotas and the rates of customs duty applicable; whereas in establishing the volume of these tariff quotas, account should be taken that during 1992 and/or 1993 some products have received the benefit of  a reduced duty or zero-duty tariff quota by application to the agreements currently in force with the countries in question; whereas it is consequently appropriate to repeal, with effect from 15 April 1993, Regulations (EEC) No 1694/92 (2) and (EEC) No  221/93 (3) in their entirety and those parts of Regulation (EEC) No 303/93 (4) relating to the tariff quotas under order No 09.0801; whereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure equal and uninterrupted access for all Community importers to the said  quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up;\nWhereas the decision opening tariff quotas should be taken by the Community in pursuance of its international obligations; whereas, to ensure the efficient common administration of the quotas, there is no reason why Member States should not be allowed  to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method of administration nonetheless requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able  to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of these quotas may be carried  out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
