Since more information on the safety of those hair dyes was needed in order for the Scientific Committee for Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers (SCCNFP) to finish the risk assessment of those substances, those hair dyes have been provisionally allowed to be employed in cosmetic products until 30 September 2004.\n(2) In December 2002, the SCCNFP set the basic requirements to carry out a modern risk assessment of hair dyes. Following the process of consultation with the Member States and stakeholders it was agreed in December 2003 that the date of July 2005 was appropriate for the presentation to the SCCNFP of the additional information on hair dyes meeting the new requirements. Therefore, the period for which those hair dyes have been included in part 2 of Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC has to be extended.\n(3) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["In part 2 of Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC, the date \u201830.9.2004\u2019 in column g for reference numbers 1 to 60 is replaced by \u201831.12.2005\u2019.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 October 2004 at the latest.
