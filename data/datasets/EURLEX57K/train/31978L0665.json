This Annex describes the method to be used to determine the relationship between the indicated power of the dynamometer and the actual power absorbed by the dynamometer.\nThe actual power absorbed by the dynamometer (Pa) is the power absorbed by the brake, plus the power absorbed due to friction within the dynamometer, but not the power loss due to the friction between the tyre and roller.\n2. This method disregards the variations in the internal friction of the roller(s), which are due to the load applied by the vehicle.\n3. According to this method the power absorbed is determined on the basis of the deceleration times of the roller(s). The difference between the deceleration time of the driven roller and that of the free roller can be disregarded in the case of two-roller dynamometers, i.e. the time to be taken into consideration is that of the driven roller.\n4. The following procedure will be used:      4.1. Use a flywheel or any other means of simulating the inertia of the mass of the vehicle. Select for this purpose the inertial mass with which the dynamometer is most commonly used.\n4.2. Bring the dynamometer up to speed by placing the vehicle on the rollers, or by any other method.\n4.3. A fifth wheel, revolution counter or any other suitable device may be used to measure the speed(s) of the roller(s).\n4.4. Bring the roller(s) to a speed of 50 km/h and apply a suitable power to the dynamometer in accordance with the table in point 4.2 of Annex III.\n4.5. Note the power indicated (Pi).\n4.6. Bring the roller(s) to a speed of at least 60 km/h.\n4.7. Disengage the device used to bring the dynamometer up to speed (there must be no vehicle on the roller(s)).\n4.8. Note the times taken for the speed of the roller(s) to decrease from 55 to 45 km/h.\n4.9. The power Pa is to be calculated using the formula: >PIC FILE= \"T0013477\">\nwhere:\nPa = power absorbed by the dynamometer in kW,\nM1 = equivalent inertia of the driven roller in kg,\nV1 = initial speed in m/s (55 km/h = 15 728 m/s),\nV2 = final speed in m/s (45 km/h = 12 750 m/s),\nt = time needed by the roller(s) to slow down from 55 to 45 km/h.\n4.10. Repeat operations 4.4 to 4.9 a sufficient number of times to cover the range of powers set out in Annexes III and V.\n4.11.
