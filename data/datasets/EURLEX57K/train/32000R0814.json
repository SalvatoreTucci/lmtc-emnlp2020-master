Under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 October 1998 on legal bases and implementation of the budget(5), a basic act is also needed for the measures covered by this Regulation.\n(5) The common agricultural policy is often misunderstood because of a dearth of information. The only way to rectify this situation is through a consistent, objective and comprehensive information and communication strategy.\n(6) The issues surrounding the common agricultural policy and its development should be explained to both farmers and other parties directly concerned, as well as the general public, both inside and outside the Community. Proper implementation of the common agricultural policy depends to a large extent on the explanation given to all protagonists and necessitates the integration of information measures, which are regarded as management components of that policy.\n(7) The priority measures which the Community may support should be defined.\n(8) Organisations representing those active in farming and in rural areas, particularly farmers' organisations, consumers' associations and environmental protection associations play a vital role in informing their members about the common agricultural policy and relaying to the Commission the opinions of the parties concerned in general and farmers in particular.\n(9) Since the common agricultural policy is the first and most extensive of the Community's integrated policies, it should be explained to the general public. Other parties likely to be able to present information projects that will help achieve this goal should therefore be eligible to make proposals.\n(10) The Commission must have the necessary resources to implement the information actions it wishes to realise in the area of agriculture.\n(11) Although activities that can be assisted under other Community programmes should not be financed under this Regulation, the complementarity of such activities with other Community initiatives should nevertheless be encouraged.\n(12) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6),", "main_body": ["The Community may finance information measures relating to the common agricultural policy that aim, in particular, at:\n(a) helping, on the one hand, to explain and, on the other hand, to implement and develop that policy,\n(b) promoting the European model of agriculture and helping people understand it,\n(c) informing farmers and other parties active in rural areas,\n(d) raising public awareness of the issues and objectives of that policy.\nThese actions aim to supply coherent, objective and comprehensive information, both inside and outside the Community, in order to give an overall picture of that policy.", "1. The measures referred to in Article 1 may be:\n(a) annual work programmes presented, in particular, by farmers' or rural development organisations, consumers' associations and environmental protection associations,\n(b) specific measures presented by any party other than those referred to in (a), in particular the public authorities of the Member States, the media and universities,\n(c) activities implemented at the Commission's initiative.\n2. The maximum financing rate for the measures referred to in paragraph 1(a) and (b) shall be 50 % of eligible costs. However, the rate may be increased to 75 % in exceptional cases, to be specified in the implementing Regulation.\n3. The following measures may not receive Community financing as provided for in Article 1:\n(a) measures which are required by law,\n(b) measures already receiving financing under another Community operation.\n4. In order to implement activities as referred to in paragraph 1(c), the Commission may have recourse to any technical and administrative assistance it might need.", "1. Measures eligible under Article 2 shall include, in particular, talks, seminars, information visits, publications, media actions and productions, participation in international events and programmes for the exchange of experience.\n2.
