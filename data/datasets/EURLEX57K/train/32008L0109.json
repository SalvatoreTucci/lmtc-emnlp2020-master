They are based on the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) No 15 on \u2018Guidelines for regulating wood packaging material in international trade\u2019\u00a0(2).\n(2) In addition to the requirements approved under ISPM No 15, Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC includes a requirement that imported wood packaging material be made from debarked wood. The application of that debarking requirement has been postponed twice.\n(3) The Community has requested that ISPM No 15 be reviewed to include a requirement addressing the Community\u2019s concern about the risk posed by the presence of bark on such wood packaging material in international trade.\n(4) The Technical Panel on Forest Quarantine (TPFQ), established under the auspices of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and composed of internationally recognised forestry experts, has now analysed the available research data on the phytosanitary risk posed by bark on wood packaging material. The TPFQ concluded that there is technical justification to require that wood packaging material in international trade should be free from bark with a precisely defined tolerance level for the presence of small pieces of bark ensuring that the phytosanitary risk is kept to an acceptable level and that such requirement should be included in the revised ISPM No 15.\n(5) In order to protect the territory of the Community from the introduction of harmful organisms the Community requirements for the presence of bark on wood packaging material and dunnage should be brought in line with the TPFQ technical conclusions without waiting for the adoption of a revised ISPM No 15 by the IPPC Commission on Phytosanitary Measures.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to adapt the debarking requirement to that technically justified tolerance level for the presence of bark.\n(7) Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The requirement that wood packaging material be made from debarked round wood introduced by Commission Directive 2006/14/EC\u00a0(3) amending Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC will apply from 1 January 2009. It is therefore necessary that the measures provided for in this Directive also apply from 1 January 2009. However, in order to allow third countries to make the necessary adaptations it is appropriate to provide that the bark requirement should apply as from 1 July 2009.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC is amended in accordance with the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 December 2008 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
