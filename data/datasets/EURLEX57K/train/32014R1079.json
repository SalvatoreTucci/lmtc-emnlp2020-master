This interest rate corresponds to the average of the 3-month and 12-month forward Euribor rates, recorded in the six months preceding the notification from the Member States provided for in the first paragraph of point I.2 of that Annex, with a weighting of one third and two thirds respectively.\n(3) Furthermore, in accordance with the second paragraph of point I.2 of Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) No\u00a0906/2014, in the absence of any notification from a Member State, in the form and by the deadline referred to in the first paragraph of that point, the interest rate borne by that Member State shall be considered to be 0 %. Where a Member State declares that it did not bear any interest costs because it did not have agricultural products in public storage during the reference period, the Commission shall fix that interest rate in accordance with the third paragraph of that point.\n(4) In accordance with point I.3 of Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) No 906/2014, the interest rate determined on the basis of point I.2 of that Annex is to be compared with the uniform interest rate fixed on the basis of point I.1 of that Annex. The interest rate applicable to each Member State shall be the lower of these two interest rates\n(5) Given that there were no agricultural products in public storage during the six months reference period from March to August 2014, Member States were not requested to make notifications under the first paragraph of point I.2 of Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) No 906/2014.\n(6) The interest rates applicable for the 2015 EAGF accounting year should be fixed taking those various factors into account,", "main_body": ["For expenditure relating to the financing costs incurred by Member States in mobilising funds to buy in products chargeable to the 2015 accounting year of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), the interest rates provided for in Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) No 906/2014 in accordance with Article 3(1)(a) of that Regulation shall be the uniform interest rate fixed at 0,4 %.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0347, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a0549.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 906/2014 of 11 March 2014 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to public intervention expenditure (OJ L\u00a0255, 28.8.2014, p.\u00a01)."}
