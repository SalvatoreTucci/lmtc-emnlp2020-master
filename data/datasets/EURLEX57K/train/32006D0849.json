It concluded that the programme had achieved its objectives and recommended its continuation.\n(3) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 38 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management\u00a0(3) is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty.\n(4) The continuation of the programme reflects the need for continuing vigilance, training and technical assistance necessary to sustain the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, by providing a stable framework for the planning of Member States programmes, particularly over a period during which new countries adopt the single currency.\n(5) In this spirit, the Commission submitted on 8 April 2005 a proposal for the continuation of the Pericles programme\u00a0(4) until 31 December 2011.\n(6) Pending final agreement on the Community Financial Framework for 2007-2013, the Council decided to extend the Pericles programme for the year 2006.\n(7) In its declaration of 30 January 2006 the Council considered that the Pericles programme has a multi-annual nature and that it should be extended to 2011. To this effect, it invited the Commission to present a proposal for extending the programme for the period starting from 2007, as soon as an agreement on the Financial Framework for 2007-2013 had been reached.\n(8) It is appropriate that the Community programmes be in line with the Community's Financial Framework.\n(9) In order to avoid overlaps and to ensure consistency and complementarity of actions under the Pericles programme, it is important to develop synergies between actions financed by the Commission, the European Central Bank and Europol.\n(10) Consequently, and in view of the need for continuous training and assistance for the protection of the euro, the Pericles programme should be extended until 31\u00a0December 2013. Decision 2001/923/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDecision 2001/923/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(2), the last sentence shall be replaced by the following:\n2. the following subparagraph is added at the end of Article 6:\n3.
