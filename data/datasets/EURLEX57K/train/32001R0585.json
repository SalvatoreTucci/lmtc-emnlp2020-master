Since those quantities exceed the limit set in Article 18(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92, the total quantities of those products on which compensation is payable should therefore be limited.\n(8) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 18(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producer organisation, the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producer organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 1997, 1998 and 1999 fishing years.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,", "main_body": ["The compensatory allowance to producer organisations for tuna delivered to the processing industry shall be granted for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2000 in respect of the following products:\n>TABLE>", "1.
