Under the terms of that framework mandate, the Agency was requested to revise the TSI on freight wagons.\n(3) On 25 March 2013, the Agency issued a recommendation on amendments to the TSI on freight wagons (ERA/REC/01-2013/INT).\n(4) It is therefore necessary to amend Commission Regulation (EU) No 321/2013 of 13 March 2013 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to
