The finding of the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus in a swine herd in Canada is the first reported possible case of human-to-animal transmission of this particular new virus subtype. However, the importance of these findings is still to be fully understood and assessed by the scientific community once sufficient scientific data are made available.\n(5) The investigation of infection dynamics, pathogenesis, host susceptibility and transmissibility of the current novel A/H1N1 influenza virus in different animal species, and in particular in pigs is essential for providing the necessary scientific evidence for a veterinary risk assessment. A key output from the study will be the development of a \u2018toolkit\u2019 of reagents and materials for laboratory diagnosis.\n(6) These investigations should be incorporated into the 2009 annual work programme of the CRL for avian influenza which has already developed models for studying infection parameters and performed some testing with influenza viruses from a variety of sources. Complementary investigations will utilise pigs, and, through a combination of multi-factorial measurements will aim at providing evidence for susceptibility and potential consequences of infection of pigs with the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus. All experiments (both on animals and in laboratory) will be carried under strict respect of biosafety and biocontainment conditions already applied at the CRL for avian influenza.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1754/2006 provides that the financial assistance from the Community is to be granted if the approved work programmes are efficiently carried out and the beneficiaries supply all the necessary information within certain time limits.\n(8) The Commission has assessed the amended complementary work programme and corresponding amended budget estimates submitted by the CRL for avian influenza.\n(9) Accordingly, an additional Community financial assistance should be granted to the CRL for avian influenza to carry out the complementary investigations on the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus.\n(10) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21\u00a0June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(5), animal disease eradication and control programmes (veterinary measures) shall be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF). Furthermore, Article 13, second paragraph of that Regulation foresees that in duly justified exceptional cases, for measures and programmes covered by Council Decision 90/424/EEC\u00a0(6), expenditure relating to administrative and personnel costs incurred by Member States and beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF shall be borne by the Fund and in this case the expenditure proposed qualifies as justified. For financial control purposes, Articles 9, 36 and 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 are to apply.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In the second paragraph of Article 13 of Decision 2008/965/EC \u2018EUR\u00a0400\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0530\u00a0000\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) Weybridge, New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey, KT15 3NB, United Kingdom; Mr Ian Brown, tel. +44\u00a01932\u00a035\u00a073\u00a039."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 July 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 18.6.2009, p. 30.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 165, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 344, 20.12.2008, p. 112.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 331, 29.11.2006, p. 8.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 209, 11.8.2005, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a019."}
