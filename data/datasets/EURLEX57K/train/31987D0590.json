OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of the Science and Technology for Development Programme is to promote increased scientific cooperation between the European Community and developing countries to their mutual benefit.\nThe main objectives are to:\n- strengthen European research capacity in areas important for the economic and social development of the developing countries;\n- develop research capacity in developing countries through active and effective links with European research institutes, which would continue after the period of Community financing;\n- in the case of the agriculture sub-programme, produce results which could help to raise the living standards of the population in the developing countries, particularly the poorest sectors of the population;\n- in the case of the medicine sub-programme, help to improve the health of that population, in particular through the prevention of disease;\n- in the case of both sub-programmes, produce results which can be disseminated as quickly and efficiently as possible and used for the benefit of those institutions in the developing countries which are able to derive benefit therefrom;\n- ensure coherence between the content of the research programme and the aims and activities of Community development aid programmes and the aid programmes of other donor countries;\n- stimulate collaboration and coordination between research activities undertaken in the Member States concerning tropical environments, in order to increase the effectiveness of these activities;\n- strengthen research teams in the developing countries, as regards both numbers (by training) and equipment.\n2. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CONTENT\nThe programme, for which the expenditure commitments are estimated at 80 million ECU, comprises the following two sub-programmes:\nA. Tropical and subtropical agriculture sub-programme:\n(The financial appropriation proposed, as an indication, for this sub-programme is 55 million ECU)\n1. improvement of agricultural products:\n- crop production: food crops; agro-industrial crops, crop genetics; crop protection;\n- proteins of animal origin; stock farming; animal genetics and reproduction; veterinary medicine;\n- sea and inland fisheries and aquaculture;\n- forestry production in humid and arid areas;\n2. conservation and better use of the environment:\n- appraisal of resources; water resources and their use; soil management and protection, desertification and management of savannahs; underexploited genetic resources; wild flora and fauna;\n3. agricultural engineering and post-harvest technology:\n- agricultural engineering/mechanization; preservation of products; processing of products;\n4. production systems:\n- multi-disciplinary approaches relating to agricultural products; intercropping; relationships between crop-growing and stock-farming; ecologically fragile environments. B. Medicine, health and nutrition in tropical and subtropical areas sub-programme\n(The financial appropriation proposed, as an indication, for this sub-programme is 25 million ECU)\n1. medicine:\n- transmissible tropical diseases: parasitological; bacterial; viral; mycological;\n- non-transmissible tropical diseases: genetic disorders; acquired diseases;\n2. health:\n- health services: operational research; planning, management and models;\n- environmental health: water-related diseases; traditional medicine - tropical medicinal plants;\n3. nutrition:\n- nutritional deficiences; impact of agricultural, alimentary and socio-economic strategies on nutritional status;\n- relationships between production and storage systems, food habits and health status;\n- bio-availability of nutrients and their toxicology.\nThe execution of research activities envisaged for the above two sub-programmes also involves training and mobility of scientific personnel, aid for equipment and the creation of research networks.\nANNEX II\nParticipation by experts in the Management and Coordination Advisory Committee for Development-linked Research\nExperts from developing countries, chosen on the basis of a fair geographical distribution and, in order to ensure coordination at international level, representatives of relevant international organizations should be invited to attend meetings of the committee when important items of the programme are on the agenda.\nRepresentatives of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research, of the Management and Coordination Advisory Committee for Medical and Health Research, of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation and, if appropriate, of other Community bodies shall be invited to participate in the committee's proceedings where necessary."}
