All virgin fibres shall originate from regions where sustainable management is applied.\nThe criteria are set at a level which promotes labelling of products made from recycled fibres, but also allows for products based on virgin fibres produced with technologies reflecting best environmental standards.\nEnvironmental criteria\n1. Emissions to water and air\n(i) The performance concerning the parameters COD, AOX, CO2 and SO2 shall be expressed in terms of load points, in relation to a reference value (referred to as a 'coefficient` for each parameter).\n>TABLE>\n(ii) The load points, L, are calculated as shown in equation 1. The actual emission for each parameter should be divided by the corresponding coefficient for this parameter.\nLi = >NUM>(emission of parameter i)\n>DEN>Ci\n(equation 1)(iii) The 'total load point sum`, P, is calculated from equation 2 by adding the load points for each parameter.\nP = L1 + L2 + L3 + L4 (equation 2)\n(iv) If any of the emissions of the parameters COD, AOX, CO2 and SO2 for a product exceed the values described as 'hurdles` in table 1, the product shall not qualify for the eco-label.\n(v) To obtain the eco-label, the total load point sum (P) for the product must not exceed 4 points.\n2. Forest management\nA declaration, charter, code of conduct or statement reflecting the commitment, applicable to the operators in charge of managing the sources from which the fibres originate, meant to implement principles and measures aimed at ensuring sustainable forest management, shall be presented (1).\nFor forests in Europe, the principles and measures referred to above, shall correspond to the guidelines for the sustainable management of forests as adopted in the context of the Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, (Helsinki, 1993). Outside Europe they shall correspond to the UNCED Forest Principles (Rio de Janeiro, June 1992) and, where applicable, to the criteria or guidelines for sustainable forest management as adopted under the respective international and regional initiatives (ITTO, Montreal Process, Tarapoto Process, UNEP/FAO Dry-Zone Africa Initiative).\n3. Minimisation of solid waste\nAll producers of pulp, paper and converted tissue products shall have a system for the handling of waste and residual products arising from the production plants. The system should be documented or explained in the application and include at least the following points:\n- procedures for separating and using recyclable materials from the waste stream,\n- procedures for recovering materials for other uses, such as incineration for raising process steam,\n- procedures for the handling of hazardous (2) waste.\n4. Fitness for use\nThe product should be fit for use.\nConsumer information\nThe product must bear the following information on the packaging:\nThis product qualifies for the Community eco-label, because\n- it contributes to the reduction of water pollution, global warming, waste and acidification,\n- it promotes the safeguarding of forests.\nIn addition to this consumer information the manufacturer may also provide a statement with the percentage of recycled fibres.\nTechnical appendix\nDefinitions and testing requirements\nAll emission parameters\nThe period for the measurements or mass balances must be based on the production during 12 months. In case of a new or a re-built production plant, the measurements must be based on at least three subsequent months of stable running of the plant. The measurements must be representative for the respective campaign.\nIf a product is made out of different pulp qualities, the emission values from the pulp production should be calculated as weighted averages of all pulps used. The total emissions should be calculated by adding the emissions from the pulp production to the emissions from the tissue production.\nIf a manufacturer of pulp or paper produces several different products at the same plant, a physical allocation of the emissions between the products could be performed. The allocation can thus separate production related to the eco-labelled product from other products. Such choices of allocations should be well documented by engineering based measurements and evaluations.\nMeasurements of water emissions should be taken on unfiltered and unsettled samples either after treatment at the plant or after treatment by a public treatment plant. COD and AOX tests should be carried out by independent test institutes or accredited laboratories. Laboratories of production plants could also be used if the local authorities, responsible for permitting the operations or emissions of these plants, approve the in-house testing programme. In this case the applicant producer may provide the reports prepared for the authorities as long as they meet the requirements of this technical appendix.\nChemical oxygen demand, COD\nCOD shall be measured in accordance with ISO 6060 or equivalent standards.\nThe minimum testing frequency should be one test per month.\nAbsorbable organic halogens, AOX\nAOX shall be measured in accordance with ISO 9562 or equivalent standards.\nThe minimum testing frequency should be one test per month. For shorter testing periods than one year, the minimum number of tests performed should cover three months. For processes where chlorine-containing chemicals are not used, AOX may not be tested.\nCarbon dioxide, CO2\nThe applicant shall provide a record of the air emissions of carbon dioxide. This record must include all sources of non-renewable fuels at the mills during the production of pulp and paper and the purchased electricity. CO2-equivalents for the energy consumption at the plants are given in table 2.\n>TABLE>\nSulphur\nThe applicant shall provide a record of sulphur emissions with the aim of specifying the air emissions of sulphur. The record must include all sulphur emissions that occur during the production of pulp and paper with the exception of those arising from the generation of grid electricity. Measurements must include recovery boilers, lime kilns, steam boilers and destruction furnaces for strong smelling gases, if available. Diffuse emissions from undefined sources must be accounted for.\nForest management\nThe pulp mill shall, by a written declaration, document that the fibres used for the production of the tissue are either recycled or based on virgin fibres deriving from forests which are managed within the principles of the criteria presented above.\nWaste management\nThe applicant shall provide a document describing the procedures for the handling of wastes and residual materials from the different stages of the pulp and paper production according to the requirements mentioned above.\nFitness for use\nThe applicant should provide evidence to demonstrate that the product is fit for use. This evidence may include data from appropriate ISO or CEN test methods, but may include in-house test procedures as well. Details of the test procedures should be provided with the application.\n(1) Not required in the case of 100 % recycled paper or if 100 % non-wood based fibres are used.\n(2) As defined by the Regulatory Authority in the country where the processing is carried out."}
