whereas that quota should be opened on a multiannual basis for periods of 12 months commencing on 1 July (hereinafter referred to as 'the year of import`) and the detailed rules of application laid down;\nWhereas experience has shown that limiting imports may lead to speculative import licence applications; whereas, in order to ensure that the planned measures function properly, the greater part of the quantities available should be allocated to 'traditional` importers of cows and heifers of specified mountain breeds; whereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body threaten to restrict access by importers to this part of the quota; whereas there should be provision to correct any harm caused;\nWhereas, in order to avoid forcing trade relations in this product group into an excessively rigid mould, a second tranche should be made available to traders who are able to show that they are engaged in genuine trade of some scale with third countries; whereas, in this connection and in order to ensure efficient management, the trader concerned must be required to have imported at least 15 head during the 12 months preceding the year of import in question; whereas a batch of 15 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and experience shows that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered genuine and viable;\nWhereas verification of these criteria requires all applications to be submitted in the Member State where the importer is registered for VAT purposes;\nWhereas in order to prevent speculation, traders no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 July of the year of import in question should be denied access to the quota;\nWhereas provision should be made for the system to be administered by means of import licences; whereas to that end detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which should appear in applications and licences should be laid down, if necessary by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98 (5), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 759/98 (7); whereas, moreover, provision should be made for the licences to be issued after a period of consideration and subject where necessary to a uniform percentage reduction;\nWhereas, so that the destination can be checked, provision should be made for imported animals to be identified in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 of 21 April 1997 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products (8);\nWhereas Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97 (10), provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate on account of their end-use; whereas the animals imported should be monitored to ensure they are not slaughtered during a certain period; whereas, to ensure that slaughter does not take place, a security should be required to cover the difference between the duties under the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) and the reduced duties applicable when the animals in question were entered for free circulation;\nWhereas Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1012/98 of 14 May 1998 opening and providing for the management of tariff quotas for the import of bulls, cows and heifers, other than for slaughter, of certain alpine and mountain breeds (11) states that, in order to comply with the ban on slaughter of the imported animals within a certain period, a security equivalent to the specific amount of the CCT customs duties should be provided;\nWhereas this amount does not cover the whole of the customs debt in the case of non-compliance with the obligations relating to this quota; whereas the amount of the security should therefore be adjusted to reflect the difference between the CCT duties and the reduced duties;\nWhereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body threaten to restrict access by traditional importers to the part of the quota covered by the above Regulation; whereas there should therefore be provision to correct any harm caused;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.

All notifications, including notifications of nil applications, shall be made by telex or fax, drawn up on the basis of the specimens in Annexes III and IV in the case where applications have in fact been lodged.", "1. The Commission shall decide to what extent applications may be accepted.\n2. As regards the applications referred to in Article 4(4), if the quantities in respect of which applications are made exceed the quantities available, the Commission shall reduce the quantities applied for by a fixed percentage.\nIf the reduction referred to in the preceding subparagraph results in a quantity of less than 15 head per application, the allocation shall be made by drawing lots, by batches of 15 head, by the Member States concerned. If the remaining quantity is less than 15 head, that quantity shall constitute a single batch.", "1. Imports of the quantities allocated shall be subject to presentation of an import licence.\n2. Licence applications may be submitted only to the competent authorities in the Member State where the applicant is entered in the national VAT register.\n3. Upon notification of allocation from the Commission, import licences shall be issued at the earliest opportunity at the request and in the name of importers who have obtained import rights.\n4. Import licences shall be valid for 90 days from their date of issue. However, they shall expire no later than 30 June following the date of issue.\n5. Licences issued shall be valid throughout the Community.\n6.
