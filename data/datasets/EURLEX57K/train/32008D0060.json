This minimum set included two types of analogue leased line and three types of digital leased line with speeds ranging up to 2\u00a0048 kbit/s.\n(2) With the widespread migration to new network architectures, analogue types of leased line are no longer technically relevant. Demand for digital leased lines, which is increasingly for high-speed connections over and above 2\u00a0048 kbit/s, is being met by the market. Public consultation has revealed broad support from the Member States, industry associations and stakeholders to remove the five types of leased line from the current minimum set.\n(3) Article 18(3) of the Universal Service Directive provides for the Commission to delete certain types of leased lines from the minimum set.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Communications Committee,", "main_body": ["The list entitled \u2018Identification of the minimum set of leased lines with harmonised characteristics and associated standards\u2019 is hereby deleted from the Annex to Decision 2003/548/EC.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nViviane REDING\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 33.
