It also provides for that quota to be divided into four quantities of 1\u00a0250 tonnes, each to be available per quarter, and for the possibility of a quarterly carry-over of unused quantities available per quarter.\n(3) As a result of the amendment introduced by Regulation (EC) No 360/2004, the quarterly carry-over provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2973/79 has become obsolete and should be deleted.\n(4) Moreover, in view of the rate of use of the above mentioned quota and the abolition of the possibility of a quarterly carry-over, there is no longer any point in maintaining the obligation to divide that quota into four identical quarterly quantities. Consequently, the quarterly breakdown into available quantities should also be abolished.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2973/79 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["In Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2973/79, the second subparagraph is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 August 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 21.
