That Directive incorporated UN regulations in the EU type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that Directive, UN regulations have increasingly replaced Union legislation in the framework of the EU type-approval.\n(4) In the light of experience and technical developments, the requirements relating to certain elements or features covered by UN Regulations Nos\u00a04, 6, 11, 13, 13-H, 19, 25, 34, 37, 43, 44, 48, 53, 70, 96, 98, 104, 105, 106, 107, 112, 113, 121, 128 need to be adapted.\n(5) In order to harmonise the relevant safety provisions for the type-approval of motor vehicles, the new UN Global Technical Regulation on tyres should be adopted. Also, an amendment to Mutual Resolution No\u00a01 needs to be adopted to reflect technical progress.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to establish the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf in the Administrative Committee of the Revised\u00a01958 Agreement and in the Executive Committee of the Parallel Agreement, as regards the adoption of those UN acts,", "main_body": ["The position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union in the Administrative Committee of the Revised\u00a01958 Agreement and in the Executive Committee of the Parallel Agreement on\u00a011 to\u00a014\u00a0November\u00a02014 shall be to vote in favour of the UN acts listed in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 November 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP.
