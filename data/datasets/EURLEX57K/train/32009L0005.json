The most serious infringements are to include those which create a serious risk of death or serious personal injury.\n(3) Providing further guidance on the categorisation of infringements is an important step towards ensuring legal certainty for undertakings and fairer competition between undertakings.\n(4) A harmonised categorisation of infringements is also desirable in order to provide a common basis for the risk rating systems which Member States have to introduce according to Article 9(1) of Directive 2006/22/EC. Based on these harmonised categories, the inclusion of infringements committed by a driver or an undertaking in other Member States than the Member State of establishment would be facilitated.\n(5) As a general rule, the categorisation of infringements should depend on their gravity and the possible consequences for road safety, as well as on the ability to control the driver\u2019s and the undertaking\u2019s compliance with the legislation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 2006/22/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2009 at the latest.
