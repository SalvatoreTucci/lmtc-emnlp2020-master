The experience with this provision has been very positive and therefore the possibility should be continued and that deadline should be removed.\n(3) Technical progress in the tyre-producing sector is very fast. Due to strong demand from consumers and the car industry, the production cycles of tyres become faster and the variety of tyre types is constantly increasing. This situation is expected to become even more critical in the future since very expensive or unique test installations and expertise will be required. In order to be able to bring the newly developed products on to the market without delay, a sufficient number of test facilities, which can be used in a flexible manner, is indispensable.\n(4) In line with the development of superior tyres due to technical progress, the related test procedures need to be more and more sophisticated. There is currently no test capacity outside that of tyre manufacturers that would be able to cope with the high number of tests needed.\n(5) Directive 92/23/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Article 13(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC,", "main_body": ["Point 1.3 of Annex I to Directive 92/23/EEC is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.3.
