However, a major part of Community territory remains free from the organism.\n(3) The implementation of the emergency measures laid down in Decision 2003/766/EC was evaluated by the Standing Committee on Plant Health on several occasions during 2005. It was concluded that the emergency measures for eradication of the organism in areas where the organism was previously not known to occur should be supplemented by containment measures in all other areas.\n(4) Decision 2003/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/766/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
