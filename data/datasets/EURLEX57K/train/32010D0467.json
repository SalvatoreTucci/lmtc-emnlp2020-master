In addition, Member States are to conduct official annual surveys for the presence of the specified organism or evidence of infection by the specified organism on plants of the Palmae family in their territory and notify the Commission and the other Member States of the results of those surveys.\n(2) The official annual surveys carried out by the Member States in 2009 show that the specified organism also infested plant species belonging to the Palmae family which are not defined as susceptible plants in Decision 2007/365/EC. Therefore, it is necessary to include the plant species belonging to Palmae in the list of susceptible plants in Decision 2007/365/EC in order to allow for the emergency measures provided for in that Decision to apply also to those species.\n(3) Missions carried out by the Commission in Member States, in particular in 2009, showed that the results of the application of Decision 2007/365/EC were not fully satisfactory as regards the measures to be taken in cases where the specified organism is detected. In addition to the findings of those missions, the Commission received further information on the methods of control, containment and eradication of the specified organism, in January 2010, from a group of experts formed by the Commission to assist it in this context and including experts from all Member States affected by the specified organism, and in May 2010, on the occasion of an international conference on the specified organism, which took place in Spain. Taking into account the results of those missions and the information received in 2010, it is necessary to make certain amendments to Decision 2007/365/EC.\n(4) The information received in 2009 and in 2010 suggests that the risk of possible spread of the specified organism through import of susceptible plants from third countries or from areas in third countries, that are not free from the specified organism cannot, due to the cryptic biology of the specified organism, be adequately mitigated by appropriate preventive treatments. Such treatments do not sufficiently prevent spreading of the specified organism from susceptible plants which are infested but show no symptoms. It is therefore necessary to place susceptible plants imported from those third countries or from those areas in third countries in a site in the Union with complete physical protection.\n(5) In cases where the specified organism appears in a Member State or in a part of a Member State, in which its presence was previously unknown, the Member State concerned should immediately, and in any case within five days, notify the Commission and the other Member States. To this aim, it should also be ensured that the responsible official body of that Member State is immediately informed. In most cases the Member State concerned should further define a demarcated area, draw up an action plan and implement that action plan. In order to facilitate an integrated approach for the eradication of the organism the action plan should set out all the measures, the reasons for those measures, describing the situation and the scientific data and the criteria on which those measures were selected.\n(6) However, in some cases it may occur that only plants belonging to one consignment were identified as infested in an area, in which the specified organism was previously not known to occur within a radius of 10\u00a0km around those infested plants, that the infestation is linked to a consignment that was moved recently into that area and that that consignment had already been infested by the specified organism prior to movement. In those cases, and only where there is no risk of spreading of the specified organism, Member States should have the possibility to decide not to establish the demarcated area and to limit the official measures to the destruction of the infested material, carrying out an intensified survey programme and the tracing of related plant material.\n(7) In order to provide the Commission and the other Member States with detailed information on the spreading of the specified organism and on the official measures taken to contain and eradicate it, the Member States concerned should submit the official annual surveys to the Commission together with up-to-date action plans and, where applicable, an up-to-date list of the demarcated areas including a description and location of those areas.\n(8) Decision 2007/365/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/365/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
