Prior to the epidemic a virus of low pathogenicity had been circulating in the area.\n(2) During monitoring for avian influenza the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza virus of subtype H7N3 was detected in the regions of Veneto and Lombardia in October 2002.\n(3) Currently the control of low pathogenic avian influenza infections is not covered by Community legislation.\n(4) The Italian competent veterinary authorities have taken control measures to avoid the spread of disease to other areas; however the infection cannot be contained sufficiently.\n(5) Low pathogenic virus may mutate to highly pathogenic virus and may cause severe disease outbreaks.\n(6) During the previous avian influenza epidemic in Italy a vaccination programme was approved by the Commission in connection with intensive monitoring and certain provisions for intra-Community trade in live poultry and poultry products.\n(7) As a follow-up of the vaccination campaign certain measures concerning movement restrictions for intra-Community trade of live poultry and poultry products were maintained by the adoption of Commission Decision 2002/552/EC(6).\n(8) The experience of the Italian vaccination campaign suggests that this has successfully stopped the spread of the low pathogenic avian influenza virus.\n(9) Avian influenza virus subtype H7N3 is responsible for the current infections, whereas the previous epidemic was caused by an H7N1 virus subtype.\n(10) The infection occurs at present in an area of Italy with dense poultry population.\n(11) In this context vaccination can be an effective tool to supplement disease control measures against avian influenza.\n(12) Where vaccination against avian influenza is practised movement restrictions for vaccinated poultry have to be implemented.\n(13) Italy has presented a vaccination programme to supplement the measures to control avian influenza in a limited area of Italy including specific movement restrictions.\n(14) Italy has authorised the use of two inactivated vaccines against avian influenza for the implementation of the programme. For the initial phase a homologous vaccine is obtained from the master seed strain CK/Pak/1995-H7N3 and for the following period starting from early 2003 a heterologous vaccine with the master seed strain A/CK/Italy/AG-473/1999-H7N1 shall be used.\n(15) Within a technical working group meeting the vaccination programme presented by Italy was reviewed.\n(16) Monitoring on vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry flocks shall be continued including the use of the serological test (iIFA-test) which had been approved by Commission Decision 2001/847/EC(7).\n(17) Italy shall introduce specific movement restrictions related to vaccination of poultry and to intra-Community trade.\n(18) For reasons of clarity Decision 2002/552/EC should be repealed as its provisions are superseded by this Decision.\n(19) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The vaccination programme against avian influenza presented by Italy is hereby approved and shall be carried out in the area described in Annex I.", "The restrictions on movements of live birds, hatching eggs, table eggs and fresh poultry meat into, out of and within the area described in Annex I shall apply as laid down in the vaccination programme referred to in Article 1.", "1.
