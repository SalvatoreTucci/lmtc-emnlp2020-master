The Estonian and Lithuanian competent veterinary authorities have committed themselves that, for the purpose of exporting pig meat, a list of pig holdings kept under regular veterinary supervisions and where appropriate controls are carried out to exclude any use of catering waste for feeding to pigs will be established.\n(7) Decision 98/371/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 98/371/EC is replaced by the Annex to the present Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 July 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 302, 31.12.1972, p. 28.\n(2) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\n(3) OJ L 170, 16.6.1998, p. 16.\n(4) OJ L 325, 30.11.2002, p. 40.\nANNEX\n\"\"\nANNEX II\nAnimal health guarantees to be requested on certification of fresh meat\n>TABLE>\nN.B.\nImports of fresh meat for human consumption are not allowed unless a programme of control of residues in the exporting third country has been approved by the Commission."}
