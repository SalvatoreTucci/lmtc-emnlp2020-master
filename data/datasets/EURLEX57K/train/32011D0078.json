The presence of that disease close to the Union border constitutes a serious risk to the livestock population in the Union.\n(4) The transporter should ensure that for each vehicle used for the transport of animals a register containing information on cleansing and disinfection is retained for a minimum period of 3 years according to Council Directive 64/432/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(5) Import of pigs and pig meat products is not permitted from Russia, however the virus causing the disease persists also in a contaminated environment outside the host animal and can be introduced into the Union with vehicles which have transported pigs.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to adopt certain protection measures at Union level taking into account the risk of the spread of the disease, virus survival in the environment and potential routes of its transmission. In particular, it is necessary to ensure that vehicles which have transported pigs and which enter the Union from Russia are appropriately cleansed and disinfected.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision, \u2018livestock vehicle\u2019 means any vehicle being used or which has been used for the transport of pigs.", "Member States shall ensure that the operator or driver of a livestock vehicle on arrival from Russia at the point of entry into the territory of the Union provides information to the competent authority of the Member State showing that the vehicle has been cleansed and disinfected after the last unloading of pigs.\nThat information may be presented in the form of a declaration as set out in Annex I or in another equivalent form.
