Motor vehicles equipped with positive-ignition (petrol) engines\n(a) where the exhaust emissions are not controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter which is lambda-probe controlled.\n1. Visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that there are no leakages.\n2. If appropriate, visual inspection of the emission control system in order to check that the required equipment has been fitted.\nAfter a reasonable period of engine conditioning (taking account of the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations) the carbon monoxide (CO) content of the exhaust gases is measured when the engine is idling (no load).\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the vehicle manufacturer. Where this information is not available or where Member States' competent authorities decide not to use it as a reference value, the CO content must not  exceed the following:\n- for vehicles registered or put into service for the first time between the date from which Member States required the vehicles to comply with Directive 70/220/EEC (\u00b9) and 1 October 1986:\nCO - 4,5 vol %,\n- for vehicles registered or put into service for the first time after 1 October 1986:\nCO - 3,5 vol %.\n(b) where the exhaust emissions are controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter which is lambda-probe controlled.\n1. Visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that there are no leakages and that all parts are complete.\n2. Visual inspection of the emission control system in order to check that the required equipment has been fitted.\n3. Determination of the efficiency of the vehicle's emission control system by measuring the lambda value and the CO content of the exhaust gases in accordance with Section 4 or with the procedures proposed by the manufacturers and approved at the time  of type-approval. For each of the tests the engine is conditioned in accordance with the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations.\n4. Exhaust pipe emissions - limit values\n- Measurement at engine idling speed:\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the vehicle manufacturer. Where this information is not available, the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,5 vol %.\n- Measurement at high idle speed, engine speed to be at least 2 000 rpm:\nCO content: maximum 0,3 vol %\nLambda: 1 +/- 0,03 or in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.\n8.2.2. Motor vehicles equipped with compression ignition (diesel) engines\nMeasurement of exhaust gas opacity with free acceleration (no load from idling up to cut-off speed). The level of concentration must not exceed the level recorded on the plate pursuant to Directive 72/306/EEC (\u00b2). Where this information is not available  or where Member States' competent (\u00b9) Council Directive 70/220/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by gases from positive-ignition engines of motor vehicles  (OJ No L 76, 9. 3. 1970, p. 1).

Test equipment\nVehicle emissions are tested using equipment designed to establish accurately whether the limit values prescribed or indicated by the manufacturer have been complied with.\n8.2.4. Where, during EEC type-approval, a type of vehicle is found not to have satisfied the limit values laid down by this Directive, the Member States may lay down higher limit values for that type of vehicle on the basis of proof supplied by the  manufacturer. They must inform the Commission thereof forthwith and it in turn will inform the other Member States."}
