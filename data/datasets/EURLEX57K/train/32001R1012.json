The situation thus created has seriously affected export opportunities under the conditions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1370/95, (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1291/2000.\n(7) Those adverse effects must be mitigated by adopting special measures, in particular to cancel export licences issued and extend certain time limits laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1370/95, (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1291/2000 relating to certain export operations which could not be completed because of the circumstances mentioned. In particular, operators who have already completed customs export formalities or placed their products under customs supervision should be allowed the same benefit derived from extending the term of licence validity by extending the transport time limit provided for in Regulation (EC) No 800/1999.\n(8) Only those operators who can prove, on the basis of the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89(13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3235/94(14), that they were unable to carry out the export operations within the time limits laid down as a result of the circumstances mentioned above should be allowed to benefit from the derogations.\n(9) In view of the rate at which events are developing this Regulation must enter into force immediately.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["1.
