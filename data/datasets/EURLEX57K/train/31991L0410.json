Specific cases\nIf it seems obvious that packaging is sufficiently safe for children because they cannot get access to the contents without the help of a tool, the test doesn't need to be performed.\nIn all other cases and when there are sufficient grounds for doubting the security of the closure for a child, the national authority may ask the person responsible for putting the product on the market to give him a certificate from a test house described below, that either:     - the type of closure is such that it is not necessary to test to the ISO standard referred to above,\nor\n- the closure has been tested and has been found to conform with the standard referred to above.\nPart B  Provisions relating to tactile warning devices\nThe technical specifications for tactile warning devices shall conform with EN standard 272 (20 August 1989 edition) relating to tactile warning of danger.\""}
