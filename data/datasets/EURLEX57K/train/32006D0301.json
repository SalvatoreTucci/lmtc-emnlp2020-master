Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation and questionnaires were sent to all parties concerned.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(5) By a letter dated 31st January 2006 and addressed to the Commission, the complainant formally withdrew its complaint. According to the complainant, this withdrawal was prompted by the recent significant change in the Generalised System of Preferences on ethyl alcohol originating in Pakistan. According to the complainant, though this has not eliminated dumping practices, it has helped to significantly curb the large and injurious volumes of imports from Pakistan into the Community. As the injury data in the complaint was based on the combined effect of imports from Guatemala and Pakistan, the complainant believed that the withdrawal of the complaint with regard to both countries is a reasonable course of action at the present time.\n(6) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(7) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any consideration showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. However, no comments which could alter this decision were received.\n(8) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of ethyl alcohol originating in Guatemala and Pakistan should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ethyl alcohol, whether denatured or undenatured, having an alcoholic strength by volume of 80\u00a0% vol or higher, originating in Guatemala and Pakistan, normally declared under CN codes 2207\u00a010\u00a000 and ex\u00a02207\u00a020\u00a000 is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 April 2006.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.
