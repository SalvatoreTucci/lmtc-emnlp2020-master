Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 866/1999\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that micro-organism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of 3-phytase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 528.94) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 418/2001\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of 3-phytase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 528.94) was provisionally authorised for the first time for sows and turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 358/2005\u00a0(5). It was authorised without a time-limit for pigs for fattening and piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 943/2005\u00a0(6). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to laying hens. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be provisionally authorised for four years.\n(8) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) was authorised without a time-limit for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 833/2005\u00a0(7). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to piglets. The EFSA has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be provisionally authorised for four years.\n(9) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94), endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CBS 592.94), alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553), bacillolysin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9554) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma viride (NIBH FERM BP 4842) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2437/2000\u00a0(8). It was authorised without a time-limit for chickens for fattening by Regulation (EC) No 358/2005. New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to turkeys for fattening. The EFSA has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be provisionally authorised for four years.\n(10) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(9).\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised without a time-limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex II, is authorised without a time-limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex III, are authorised provisionally for four years as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
