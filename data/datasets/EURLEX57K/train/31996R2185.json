whereas in that regard it is important that the Commission ensure that its inspectors comply with Community and national provisions on the protection of personal data, in particular those laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(5);\n(13) Whereas, if action to combat fraud and irregularities is to be effective, the Commission must carry out inspections on the premises of those economic operators who may have been involved, directly or indirectly, in the irregularity in question and on the premises of other economic operators who might be concerned by that irregularity; whereas, in the event of the application of this Regulation, the Commission should ensure that those economic operators are not simultaneously subjected, in respect of the same acts, to similar checks and inspections carried out by the Commission or by the Member States on the basis of Community sectoral rules or national legislation;\n(14) Whereas the Commission inspectors must have access to all the information on the transactions concerned on the same terms as national administrative inspectors; whereas the reports by the Commission inspectors, signed, if appropriate, by the national inspectors, must be drawn up taking into account the procedural requirements laid down in the law of the Member State concerned; whereas they must be admitted as evidence in the administrative and judicial proceedings of the Member State where it proves necessary to use them and have an identical value to the reports drawn up by national administrative inspectors;\n(15) Whereas, in cases where there is a risk of evidence disappearing, or where economic operators oppose on-the-spot checks or inspections by the Commission, it is for the Member States to take the necessary precautionary or implementing measures in accordance with their legislation;\n(16) Wheres this Regulation affects neither Member States' powers regarding the prosecution of criminal offences nor the rules governing mutual assistance between Member States on criminal matters;\n(17) Whereas the Treaties contain no powers for the adoption of this Regulation other than those provided for in Article 235 of the EC Treaty and Article 203 of the Euratom Treaty,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down the additional general provisions within the meaning of Article 10 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 which are applicable to on-the-spot administrative checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the financial interests of the Communities against irregularities as defined in Article 1 (2) of the said Regulation.\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of the Community sectoral rules, this Regulation shall apply to all areas of the Communities' activity.\nThis Regulation shall not affect Member States' powers regarding the prosecution of criminal offences or the rules governing mutual assistance in criminal matters between Member States.", "The Commission may carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections pursuant to this Regulation:\n\u2014 for the detection of serious or transnational irregularities or irregularities that may involve economic operators acting in several Member States, or\n\u2014 where, for the detection of irregularities, the situation in a Member State requires on-the-spot checks and inspections to be strengthened in a particular case in order to improve the effectiveness of the protection of financial interests and so to ensure an equivalent level of protection within the Community, or\n\u2014 at the request of the Member State concerned.", "Where the Commission decides to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections under this Regulation, it shall ensure that similar checks and inspections are not being carried out at the same time in respect of the same facts with regard to the economic operators concerned on the basis of Community sectoral regulations.\nIn addition, it shall take into account the inspections in progress or already carried out in respect of the same facts with regard to the economic operators concerned, by the Member State on the basis of its legislation.", "On-the-spot checks and inspections shall be prepared and conducted by the Commission in close cooperation with the competent authorities of the Member State concerned, which shall be notified in good time of the object, purpose and legal basis of the checks and inspections, so that they can provide all the requisite help.
