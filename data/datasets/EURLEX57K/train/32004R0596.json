In the interest of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that all exports for which export refunds are requested, with the exception of exports of hatching eggs, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund. Therefore specific implementing rules should be laid down for the egg sector which should, in particular, include provisions for the submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, in addition to those contained in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 322/2004\u00a0(8).\n(3) In order to assure proper administration of the system, the rate of the security for export licences under the said system should be fixed. In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the egg sector, export licences should not be transferable and precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down.\n(4) Article 8(12) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that compliance with the obligations arising from agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations regarding the export volume shall be ensured on the basis of the export licences. Therefore a detailed schedule for the lodging of applications and for the issuing of licences should be laid down.\n(5) In addition, the decision regarding applications for export licences should be communicated only after a period of consideration. This period would allow the Commission to appreciate the quantities applied for as well as the expenditure involved and, if appropriate, to take specific measures applicable in particular to the applications which are pending. It is in the interest of traders to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the acceptance coefficient has been fixed.\n(6) In the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes, the export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it. However, such licences should be restricted to short-term commercial transactions in order to prevent the mechanism provided for in this Regulation from being circumvented.\n(7) In order to ensure an exact follow up of the quantities to be exported, a derogation from the rules regarding the tolerances laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should be laid down.\n(8) The Commission should dispose of precise information concerning applications for licences and of the use of licences issued, in order to be able to manage this system. In the interest of efficient administration, the notifications from Member States to the Commission should be made according to a uniform model.\n(9) Article 8(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that for hatching eggs export refunds may be granted on the basis of an ex post export licence. Therefore implementing rules for such a system should be laid down with the aim of ensuring efficient verification with the obligations arising from the agreements concluded in the framework of the Uruguay Round negotiations are complied with. However, it would appear unnecessary to require the lodging of a security in the case of licences applied for after exportation.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["All exports of products in the egg sector for which an export refund is requested, with the exception of hatching eggs falling within CN codes 0407\u00a000\u00a011 and 0407\u00a000\u00a019, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 to 8.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Export licences shall be valid for 90 days from their actual day of issue within the meaning of Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for licences and licences shall bear, in section 15, the description of the product and, in section 16, the 12-digit product code of the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The categories of products referred to in the second paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, as well as the rate of the security for export licences are given in Annex I.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for licences and licences shall bear, in section 20, at least one of the following:\n\u2014 Reglamento (CE) no 596/2004\n\u2014 Forordning (EF) nr. 596/2004\n\u2014 Verordnung (EG) Nr. 596/2004\n\u2014 \u039a\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (\u0395\u039a) \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8. 596/2004\n\u2014 Regulation (EC) No 596/2004\n\u2014 R\u00e8glement (CE) no 596/2004\n\u2014 Regolamento (CE) n. 596/2004\n\u2014 Verordening (EG) nr. 596/2004\n\u2014 Regulamento (CE) n.o 596/2004\n\u2014 Asetus (EY) N:o 596/2004\n\u2014 F\u00f6rordning (EG) nr 596/2004.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for export licences may be lodged with the competent authorities from Monday to Friday of each week.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applicants for export licences shall be natural or legal persons who, at the time applications are submitted, are able to prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities in the Member States that they have been engaged in trade in the egg sector for at least 12 months.
