It is therefore appropriate to exclude importations of goods which benefit from duty relief from the application of measures to protect trade imposed on the basis of Article 133 of the Treaty.\n(2) Imports of household effects for furnishing a secondary residence are subject to the same restrictions and controls as the same goods imported by natural persons transferring their normal place of residence from a third country. Although creating the same administrative burden for the importing persons and the customs administrations in the Member States, the former types of importations do not benefit from exemption from value added tax (VAT) whereas the latter ones do. Furthermore, the economic benefits of a duty relief for imports of household effects for furnishing a secondary residence is small in comparison with the supplementary costs of controls. It is therefore appropriate to delete the provisions concerning the customs duty relief for those goods.\n(3) The value limit of ECU 22 set out in Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 has not been increased since 1991, whereas at the same time customs duties have been significantly reduced or even abolished. Accordingly, it is appropriate to increase the value limit for consignments of negligible value.\n(4) In order to ensure that no importations of VAT \u2014 exempt goods which are contained in travellers\u2019 personal luggage are subject to customs duties, the provisions for such imports of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 should be amended to take account of Council Directive 2007/74/EC of 20 December 2007 on the exemption from value added tax and excise duty of goods imported by persons travelling from third countries\u00a0(2). It is therefore appropriate to grant relief from customs duties where national VAT law implemented in accordance with Directive 2007/74/EC provides for an exemption from VAT. In this context it is necessary to ensure that the same provisions for duty relief apply in the territories set out in Article 6 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax\u00a0(3).\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1, paragraph 1 shall be replaced by the following:\n2. in Chapter I, Title IV shall be deleted;\n3. in Article 27 the value of ECU 22 shall be replaced by EUR 150;\n4.
