For the purposes of Articles 26 to 29 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 \"isoglucose production\" means the quantity of the product obtained from glucose or its polymers having a content by weight in the dry state of at least 10 % fructose, irrespective of its fructose content in excess of that limit, expressed as dry matter and recorded in accordance with paragraph 2.\n2. The quantity of the product referred to in paragraph 1 shall be recorded by:\n(a) physical metering of the tel quel volume of the product,\nand\n(b) determination of the dry matter content by refractometry,\nas soon as the isomerization process has terminated and before any operation to separate the glucose and fructose constituents or to produce mixtures.\n3. Every manufacturer of the product referrd to in paragraph 1 shall be required to notify without delay each of his factories which may be used for the isomerization of glucose or its polymers.\nNotification shall be made to the Member State on whose territory each factory is situated. The Member State may require the person concerned to furnish additional information in this respect.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 July 1984.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 February 1984.\nFor the Commission\nPoul DALSAGER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 177, 1. 7. 1981, p. 4.\n(2) OJ No L 74, 18. 3. 1982, p. 1.\n(3) OJ No L 158, 9. 6. 1982, p. 17."}
