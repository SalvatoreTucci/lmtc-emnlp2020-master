In Article 4, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 shall be replaced by the following:\n'3. A supplement to the compensatory payment of ECU 344,5 per hectare shall be paid for the area down to durum wheat in the traditional production zones listed in Annex II, subject to the limits fixed in Annex III.\nShould the total of the areas for which a supplement to the compensatory payment is claimed be greater than the limit referred to above during the course of a marketing year, the area per producer for which the supplement may be paid shall be reduced proportionately.\nHowever, subject to the limits per Member State laid down in Annex III, Member States may distribute the areas indicated in that Annex among the production zones as defined in Annex II, or, if necessary, the production regions referred to in Article 3, according to the extent of the production of durum wheat during the period 1993 to 1997. Where this is done, should the total of the areas within a region for which a supplement to the compensatory payment is requested be greater than the corresponding regional limit during the course of a marketing year, the area per producer in that production region for which the supplement may be paid shall be reduced proportionately. The reduction shall be made when, within a Member State, the areas in regions which have not reached their regional limits have been distributed to regions in which those limits have been exceeded.\n4. In regions where the production of durum wheat is well established, other than those referred to in Annex II, special aid amounting to ECU 138,9 per hectare shall be granted up to a limit of the number of hectares laid down in Annex IIIa.`\n2. In Article 12, the fifth indent shall be replaced by the following:\n'- those determining, for durum wheat, the eligibility requirements for the supplement to the compensatory payment referred to in Article 4 (3) and the eligibility requirements for the special aid referred to in Article 4 (4), and in particular determination of the regions to be taken into consideration and the measures to be taken in the event that the limit fixed for the payment of the aid is exceeded; those rules shall stipulate that the grant of the supplement provided for in Article 4 (3) and (4) be subject to the obligation to use certified seed.`\n3.
