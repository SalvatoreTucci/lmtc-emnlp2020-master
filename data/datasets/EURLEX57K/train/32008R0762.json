In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(9) Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0322/97 of 17\u00a0February 1997 on Community Statistics\u00a0(3) provides a reference framework for statistics in the field of fisheries. In particular, it requires conformity with principles of impartiality, reliability, relevance, cost-effectiveness, statistical confidentiality and transparency.\n(10) The collection and submission of statistical data is an essential tool for the sound management of the Common Fisheries Policy.\n(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28\u00a0June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(4).\n(12) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt technical changes to the Annexes to this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article\u00a05a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(13) The Commission should be assisted by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC\u00a0(5),", "main_body": ["Obligations of the Member States\nMember States shall submit to the Commission statistics on all the aquaculture activities conducted in freshwater and saltwaters on their territory.", "Definitions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018Community statistics\u2019 as defined in Article\u00a02 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0322/97;\n(b) \u2018aquaculture\u2019 as defined in Article\u00a03(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01198/2006 of 27\u00a0July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund\u00a0(6);\n(c) \u2018capture-based aquaculture\u2019 means the practice of collecting specimens from the wild and their subsequent use in aquaculture;\n(d) \u2018production\u2019 means the output from aquaculture at first sale, including production from hatcheries and nurseries offered for sale.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All other definitions for the purpose of this Regulation are set out in Annex\u00a0I.", "Compilation of statistics\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall use surveys or other statistically validated methods covering at least 90\u00a0% of the total production by volume, or by number for the production of hatcheries and nurseries, without prejudice to paragraph\u00a04.

This may be water where the salinity is constantly high (e.g. seawater) or where the salinity is appreciable but not at a constantly high level (e.g. brackish water): the salinity may be subject to periodic variation due to the influx of fresh or seawaters.\n3. \u2018Species\u2019 means the species of aquatic organisms identified using the international 3-alpha code as defined by the FAO (ASFIS list of species for fishery statistics purposes).\n4. \u2018FAO major areas\u2019 means the geographical areas identified using the international numerical-2 code as defined by the FAO (CWP Handbook of fishery statistical standards. Section H: Fishing areas for statistical purposes). The FAO major areas covered for the purpose of this Regulation are the following:\nCode Area\n01 Inland waters (Africa)\n05 Inland waters (Europe)\n27 North-east Atlantic\n34 Atlantic Eastern Central\n37 Mediterranean and Black Seas\n\u2026 Other areas (to be specified)\n5. \u2018Ponds\u2019 means relatively shallow and usually small bodies of still water or water with a low refreshment rate, most frequently artificially formed, but can also apply to natural pools, tarns, meres or small lakes.\n6. \u2018Hatcheries and nurseries\u2019 means places for the artificial breeding, hatching and rearing through the early life stages of aquatic animals. For statistical purposes, hatcheries are limited to the production of fertilised eggs. First juvenile stages of aquatic animals are considered as being produced in nurseries.\n7. \u2018Enclosures and pens\u2019 means areas of water confined by nets, mesh and other barriers allowing uncontrolled water interchange and distinguished by the fact that enclosures occupy the full water column between substrate and surface; pens and enclosures generally enclose a relatively large volume of water.\n8. \u2018Cages\u2019 means open or covered enclosed structures constructed with net, mesh or any porous material allowing natural water interchange. These structures may be floating, suspended or fixed to the substrate but still permitting water interchange from below.\n9. \u2018Tanks and raceways\u2019 means artificial units constructed above or below ground level capable of high rates of water interchange or with a high water turnover rate and highly controlled environment but without water recirculation.\n10. \u2018Recirculation systems\u2019 means systems where the water is reused after some form of treatment (e.g. filtering).\n11. \u2018Transferred to a controlled environment\u2019 means the intentional release for further aquaculture practices.\n12. \u2018Released to the wild\u2019 means the intentional release for the restocking of rivers, lakes and other waters other than for aquaculture purposes. These releases may then be available for capture by fishing operations.\n13. \u2018Volume\u2019 means:\n(a) for fish, crustaceans and molluscs and other aquatic animals, the live weight equivalent of the product. For molluscs, the live weight shall include the weight of the shell;\n(b) for aquatic plants, the wet weight of the product.\n14. \u2018Unit value\u2019 means the total value (excluding invoiced value-added tax) of the production (in national currency) divided by the total volume of the production.\nANNEX II\nProduction from aquaculture excluding nurseries and hatcheries\u00a0(1)\nCountry:     Year:\nSpecies produced FAO major area Freshwater Saltwater Total\n3-alpha code Common name Scientific name Volume Unit value Volume Unit value Volume Unit value\nFISH\nPonds\nTanks and raceways\nEnclosures and pens\nCages\nRecirculation systems\nOther methods\nCRUSTACEANS\nPonds\nTanks and raceways\nEnclosures and pens\nOther methods\nMOLLUSCS\nOn bottom\nOff bottom\nOther methods\nSEAWEEDS\nAll methods\nFish eggs (intended for consumption)\u00a0(2)\nAll methods\nOTHER AQUATIC ORGANISMS\nAll methods\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0With the exclusion of aquarium and ornamental species.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The fish eggs intended for consumption considered under this item refer only to extracted eggs destined for consumption at first sale.\nANNEX III\nInput to capture-based aquaculture\n\u00a0(1)\nCountry:   Year:\nSpecies Unit (specify)\u00a0(2) Unit value (national currency)\n3-alpha code Common name Scientific name\nFISH\n\n\n\n\n\nCRUSTACEANS\n\n\n\n\n\nMOLLUSCS\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0With the exclusion of aquarium, ornamental and plant species.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Weight or number; if numbers are provided, a conversion factor to live weight must be provided as well.\nANNEX IV\nProduction of hatcheries and nurseries\n\u00a0(1)\nCountry:        Year:\nSpecies Stage in life cycle Intended uses\n3-alpha code Common name Scientific name Eggs Juveniles Transferred to a controlled environment Released to the wild\u00a0(2)\nEggs Juveniles Eggs Juveniles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0With the exclusion of aquarium and ornamental species.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Voluntary.\nANNEX V\nData on the structure of the aquaculture sector\n\u00a0(1)\n\u00a0(4)\nCountry:    Year:\nFAO major area Freshwater Saltwater Total\nSize of the facilities\u00a0(3) Size of the facilities\u00a0(3) Size of the facilities\u00a0(3)\n(thousand m3) Hectares (thousand m3) Hectares (thousand m3)\nFISH\nPonds\nTanks and raceways\nEnclosures and pens\nCages\nRecirculation systems\nOther methods\nCRUSTACEANS\nPonds\nTanks and raceways\nEnclosures and pens\nOther methods\nMOLLUSCS\nOn bottom\u00a0(2)\nOff bottom\u00a0(2)\nOther methods\u00a0(2)\nSEAWEEDS\nAll methods\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0With the exclusion of aquarium and ornamental species.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0If molluscs are grown on ropes, length unit may be used.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Should be considered the potential capacity.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The shaded cells indicate where information is not applicable.\nANNEX\u00a0VI\nFormat for the methodological reports of the national systems for aquaculture statistics\n1. Organisation of the national system for aquaculture statistics:\n\u2014 authorities responsible for collecting and processing the data and their respective responsibilities,\n\u2014 national legislation on the collection of aquaculture data,\n\u2014 unit responsible for submitting data to the Commission.\n2.
