It must therefore employ the appropriate technical means, including military technology where necessary.\n(13) This Regulation is designed to provide the basis for a coherent and efficient approach for the Community mine action in developing countries, through advancement of an integrating strategy, in close coordination between the Commission, the Member States and the international community at all stages of mine actions.\n(14) Such an approach should not prevent a Community response to humanitarian emergencies wherever they occur.\n(15) It is necessary to ensure that these actions are consistent with the European Union's foreign policy as a whole, including the Common Foreign and Security Policy.\n(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(3).\n(17) The anti-personnel landmine problem, by its life-threatening nature and its global extent, requires efficient, flexible and, where necessary, rapid decision-making procedures for the financing of Community actions.\n(18) This Regulation establishes, for its entire duration, a financial framework which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(4).\n(19) The Community should ensure maximum transparency in the implementation of the financial assistance and stringent controls in the use of appropriations.\n(20) The protection of the Communities' financial interests as well as the fight against fraud and irregularities constitute an inherent part of this Regulation,", "main_body": ["1. This Regulation lays down the procedures for the implementation of Community operations against anti-personnel landmines within the framework of Community development cooperation policy, while advancing a consistent and coherent humanitarian mine clearance strategy in response to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of anti-personnel Mines and on their Destruction (hereinafter referred to as the \"Ottawa Convention\").\n2. The operations referred to in this Regulation shall be implemented in the territory of developing countries or shall be directly related to situations arising in developing countries, particularly in those most vulnerable amongst them and in those which are recovering from conflicts.\nMine actions shall be integrated into all country strategies for those developing countries which suffer from the consequences of antipersonnel landmines.", "1. Community action under this Regulation shall be aimed at assisting countries which suffer from the consequences of anti-personnel landmines, to create the conditions necessary for their economic and social development, by\n(a) supporting the elaboration, monitoring and implementation of a civilian mine action strategy;\n(b) assisting afflicted countries in their implementation of the Ottawa Convention;\n(c) creating and sustaining international structures and local capabilities within the afflicted countries to carry out mine actions with maximum effectiveness;\n(d) responding to humanitarian emergency, preventing casualties and assisting the rehabilitation of mine victims;\n(e) supporting the in-country trial and introduction into operational use of appropriate mine action equipment and techniques;\n(f) promoting coordination with end users of the mine clearance equipment at the early stages of research and supporting the use of these technologies in the poorest mine-affected countries;\n(g) encouraging mine clearance actions that are compatible with the local environment and consistent with the sustainable development of the affected region;\n(h) supporting coordination among international mine action actors.\n2. The operations financed under this Regulation may comprise all activities related to action against anti-personnel landmines which will support objectives necessary for economic and social development, including:\n(a) mine awareness education;\n(b) training of specialist personnel;\n(c) survey and marking of suspected areas;\n(d) detection and identification of antipersonnel landmines;\n(e) mine clearance to humanitarian standards and destruction of anti-personnel landmines in the ground and in conjunction therewith the destruction of anti-personnel landmines in stockpiles;\n(f) victim assistance, rehabilitation and socio-economic reintegration of mine victims;\n(g) information management, including geographical information systems;\n(h) other activities, which contribute to the reduction of the human, economic, and environmental impact of anti-personnel landmines.\n3. In the context of paragraph 2, priority shall be given to operations in the most seriously mine afflicted countries, where anti-personnel landmines or, in conjunction therewith, other unexploded ordnance cause many civilian casualties or where the presence or suspected presence of these devices is a major obstacle to the restoration of economic and social activity or to development and thus requires a specific long-term commitment that emergency humanitarian or reconstruction aid are unable to provide.\n4. In order to ensure coherence, complementarity and synergy within regional cooperation programmes and in the context of humanitarian aid, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development projects, mine actions which can be financed within the framework of any of those programmes or projects shall continue to be financed from the budget line on which the principal action is financed. Where necessary, these activities may be complemented or supported by mine actions financed under this Regulation.", "The operations financed under this Regulation shall in principle benefit those countries which are committed to the fight against antipersonnel landmines and are parties to the Ottawa Convention. Exceptions may be made for humanitarian emergency, for assistance to mine victims and for actions in direct support of vulnerable civil communities, such as refugees and displaced persons, or where the national administration is not functioning.", "1.

Community financing under this Regulation shall take the form of grants.\n3. Where operations are the subject of financial agreements between Community and beneficiary countries, such agreements shall stipulate that the payment of taxes, duties or any other charges is not to be covered by the Community.", "The financial framework for the implementation of Community mine actions during the period 2002 to 2009, under all applicable regulations in the context of Article 2(4), shall be EUR 240 million. Out of this amount, EUR 140 million shall be available for mine actions under this Regulation and Council Regulation (EC) No 1725/2001 of 23 July 2001 concerning action against anti-personnel landmines in third countries other than developing countries(5).\nThe annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective.", "1.

Projects shall form part of the wider development or reconstruction framework of the country or region in question, and be prioritised and appraised in terms of their positive impact and cost effectiveness.\n2. Wherever possible, the project should be clearly integrated within a national anti-personnel landmines programme coordinated by the beneficiary government or by local society in cooperation with NGOs, or by an international institution mandated for that purpose. The aim should be for the project to be taken over, in due course, by the beneficiary government itself or by local society or NGOs in order to enhance local capacity and the sustainability of the project.", "1\nAll financing agreements or contracts concluded under this Regulation shall provide for the Commission and the Court of Auditors to conduct on-the-spot checks according to the usual procedures laid down by the Commission under the rules in force, and in particular those of the Financial Regulation.\nIn addition, the Commission may carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections in conformity with Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96(7).
