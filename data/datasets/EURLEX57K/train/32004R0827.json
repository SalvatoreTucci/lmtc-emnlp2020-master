At its 2002 annual meeting it recommended the lifting of the prohibition of imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna in any form imposed by the contracting parties on Honduras.\n(7) ICCAT has taken note of the progress of cooperation with Belize and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for the conservation of Atlantic bigeye tuna. At its 2003 annual meeting it lifted, as of 1 January 2004, the prohibition of imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna in any form imposed by the contracting parties on Belize and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n(8) ICCAT's attempts to encourage Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone to comply with measures for the conservation and management of Atlantic bigeye tuna have been to no avail.\n(9) ICCAT has recommended its contracting parties to take appropriate steps to prohibit imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna products in any form from Bolivia, Georgia and Sierra Leone and to continue prohibiting such imports from Cambodia and Equatorial Guinea. These measures will be lifted as soon as it is established that the countries in question have brought their fishing practices into line with ICCAT's measures. These measures should therefore be implemented by the Community, which has sole competence in this matter. However, in view of the notification periods required by ICCAT, the ban on imports from Georgia should not enter into force until 1 July 2004.\n(10) These measures are compatible with the Community's obligations under other international agreements.\n(11) For the sake of transparency, Regulation (EC) No 1036/2001 should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Regulation,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation, \"importation\" means the customs procedures referred to in Article 4(15)(a), (15)(b) and (16)(a) to (16)(f) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(2).", "1.
