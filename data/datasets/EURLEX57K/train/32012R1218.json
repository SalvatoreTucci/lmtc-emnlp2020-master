The Annex to this Regulation reflects this new situation.\n(5) The autonomous customs duty rates for the tariff lines covered by the negotiations are currently set at levels below the new conventional duty rates resulting from the modification of concessions pursuant to Article XXVIII of GATT 1994. However, under Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, the autonomous customs duties apply when they are below the conventional duties.\n(6) The autonomous rate of duty fixed in the Common Customs Tariff should therefore be increased to the level of the conventional duty.\n(7) Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended and supplemented accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, Part Two of Annex I (\u2018Schedule of Customs Duties\u2019) shall be amended with the duties shown in the Annex to this Regulation.\nThe autonomous duties shall be set at the level of the conventional duties.", "In Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, Annex 7 of Section III of Part Three (\u2018WTO tariff quotas to be opened by the Competent Community Authorities\u2019) of Annex I shall be amended with the tariff quotas and supplemented with the volumes and duties shown in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the date of entry into force of the Agreements.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 12 December 2012.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
