At the end of this period Slovenia is to submit a detailed report on the minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume of the grapes observed in the three years in question.\n(3) On 24 April 2007 Slovenia submitted a detailed report on the minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume of the grapes harvested in the Primorska wine area, including Teran PTP Kras quality wine psr. However, as the three years in which these measures were carried out were characterised by exceptionally and abnormally good weather conditions, the Slovenian authorities believe that the values observed are not representative of the conditions normally encountered in this region and cannot be conclusive in fixing the normal natural alcoholic strength by volume for the region. They have therefore requested an extension of the period of the derogation from the minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume for these grapes.\n(4) In accordance with the conditions laid down for this derogation, the period covered should therefore be extended by two further wine years, to the 2007/08 and 2008/09 wine years, to enable table wines and quality wines psr in the Primorska wine area, including Teran PTP Kras quality wine psr, to reach the minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Annex V, point C(2)(e), and Annex VI, point E(3)(e), to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume set for zone C II for table wines and quality wines psr may be derogated from in the two consecutive wine years 2007/08 and 2008/09 for Slovenia\u2019s Primorska wine area when the weather conditions or growing conditions are exceptionally unfavourable and make it impossible to reach the minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume required in zone C II.\nHowever, the minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume may not be lower than that set for zone C I (a) for table wines and quality wines psr.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Slovenia."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 September 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
