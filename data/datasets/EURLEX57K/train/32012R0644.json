It provides that specific provisions, including model veterinary certificates, may be laid down for the transit throught the Union of live ungulates from authorised third countries, provided that such animals transit the territory of the Union under customs and official veterinary approval and supervision through approved border inspection posts and without any stop on Union territory other than those necessary for animal welfare purposes.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010\u00a0(2) lays down the veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain consignments of live animals, including ungulates. Annex I to that Regulation sets out a list of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which such consignments may be introduced into the Union, together with models of veterinary certificates to accompany those consignments.\n(3) On request by Russia to authorise the transit of live bovine animals for breeding and production from the region of Kaliningrad (Kaliningradskaya oblast) through the territory of Lithuania, an inspection was carried out by the Commission in Kaliningrad. It concluded that the animal health situation in that region appears to be favourable. On that basis, the introduction into the Union of consignments of such animals for the sole purpose of transit from the region of Kaliningrad to other parts of the territory of Russia through the territory of Lithuania by means of road vehicles should be authorised.\n(4) In addition, Lithuania can ensure the implementation of the measures provided for in Article 8(1) of Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market\u00a0(3) as regards those animals from the region of Kaliningrad that cannot complete the transit without unloading due to external circumstances.\n(5) Russia has also confirmed its agreement with Belarus under the customs union that includes both countries and which implies that the same standard veterinary-sanitary requirements on import apply in both countries.\n(6) Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should be amended to provide for the transit of live bovine animals for breeding and production from the region of Kaliningrad. The list of third countries, territories or parts thereof authorised for the introduction into the Union of certain animals set out in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) It is also necessary to provide for a model veterinary certificate for the transit of those animals. Accordingly, a model veterinary certificate \"BOV-X-TRANSIT-RU\" should be inserted in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010.\n(8) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Commission Regulation
