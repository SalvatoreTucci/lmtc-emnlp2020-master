Accordingly, those areas where the situation improved should therefore be removed from the list in the Annex to Decision 2008/855/EC and the measures provided for in that Decision should no longer apply.\n(4) New cases of classical swine fever in feral pigs in a region on both sides of the border between North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate which was free of the disease so far have been reported. Accordingly, those areas should be added to the list in the Annex to Decision 2008/855/EC and the measures provided for in that Decision should apply.\n(5) For the sake of transparency of Community legislation, the entire part of the list set out in the Annex to Decision 2008/855/EC which concerns Germany should be replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.\n(6) Decision 2008/855/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The part of the Annex to Decision 2008/855/EC which concerns Germany is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 March 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 13.11.2008, p. 19.\nANNEX\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Germany\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the federal state Rhineland-Palatinate:\n(a) in the Kreis Ahrweiler: the municipalities Adenau and Altenahr;\n(b) in the Landkreis Vulkaneifel: in the municipality Obere Kyll the localities Birgel, Esch, Feusdorf and J\u00fcnkerath, in the municipality Hillesheim the localities Berndorf, Dohm-Lammersdorf, Hillesheim, Kerpen, Nohn, Oberehe-Stroheich, \u00dcxheim, Walsdorf and Wiesbaum, in the municipality Daun the locality Dreis-Br\u00fcck, in the municipality Kelberg the localities Beinhausen, Bodenbach, Bongard, Borler, Boxberg, Br\u00fccktal, Drees, Gelenberg, Kelberg, Kirsbach, Neichen, Nitz, Reimerath and Welcherath;\n(c) the Kreise Altenkirchen and Neuwied;\n(d) in the Kreis Westerwald: the municipalities Bad Marienberg, Hachenburg, Ransbach-Baumbach, Rennerod, Selters, Wallmerod and Westerburg, the municipality H\u00f6hr-Grenzhausen north of the motorway A48, the municipality Montabaur north of the motorway A3 and the municipality Wirges north of the motorways A48 and A3.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the federal state North Rhine-Westfalia:\n(a) in the Kreis Euskirchen: the city Bad M\u00fcnstereifel, in the city of Mechernich the localities Antweiler, Harzheim, Holzheim, Lessenich, Ri\u00dfdorf, Wachendorf and Weiler am Berge, in the city of Euskirchen the localities of Billig, Euenheim, Euskirchen, Flamersheim, Kirchheim, Kuchenheim, Kreuzweingarten, Niederkastenholz, Palmersheim, Rheder, Roitzheim, Schweinheim and Stotzheim, in the municipality of Nettersheim the localities Bouderath, Buir, Engelgau, Frohngau, Holzm\u00fchlheim, Pesch, Tondorf und Roderath, in the municipality Dahlem the locality Dahlem and the municipality Blankenheim, except the locality Blankenheimer Wald;\n(b) in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis: in the city of Meckenheim the localities Ersdorf and Altendorf, in the city of Rheinbach the localities Oberdrees, Niederdrees, Wormersdorf, Todenfeld, Hilberath, Merzbach, Irlenbusch, Queckenberg, Kleinschlehbach, Gro\u00dfschlehbach, Loch, Berscheidt, Eichen and Kurtenberg, in the municipality of Swisttal the localities Miel and Odendorf, the cities Bad Honnef, K\u00f6nigswinter, Hennef (Sieg), Sankt Augustin, Niederkassel, Troisdorf, Siegburg and Lohmar and the municipalities Neunkirchen-Seelscheid, Eitorf, Ruppichteroth, Windeck and Much;\n(c) in the Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein in the municipality Kreuztal the localities Krombach, Eichen, Fellinghausen, Osthelden, Junkernhees and Mittelhees, in the city Siegen the localities Sohlbach, Dillnh\u00fctten, Geisweid, Birlenbach, Trupbach, Seelbach, Achenbach, Lindenberg, Rosterberg, R\u00f6dgen, Obersdorf, Eisern and Eiserfeld, the municipalities Freudenberg, Neunkirchen and Burbach, in the municipality Wilnsdorf the localities Rinsdorf and Wilden;\n(d) in the Kreis Olpe in the city Drolshagen the localities Drolshagen, L\u00fcdespert, Schlade, H\u00fctzemert, Feldmannshof, Gipperich, Benolpe, Wormberg, Gelsingen, Husten, Halbhusten, Iseringhausen, Brachtpe, Berlinghausen, Eichen, Heiderhof, Forth and Buchhagen, in the city of Olpe the localities Olpe, Rhode, Sa\u00dfmicke, Dahl, Friedrichsthal, Thieringhausen, G\u00fcnsen, Altenkleusheim, Rhonard, Stachelau, L\u00fctringhausen and R\u00fcblinghausen, the municipality Wenden;\n(e) in the M\u00e4rkische Kreis the cities Halver, Kierspe and Meinerzhagen;\n(f) in the city Remscheid the localities Halle, Lusebusch, Hackenberg, D\u00f6rper H\u00f6he, Niederlangenbach, Durchsholz, Nagelsberg, Kleebach, Niederfeldbach, Endringhausen, Lennep, Westerholt, Grenzwall, Birgden, Schneppendahl, Oberfeldbach, Hasenberg, L\u00fcdorf, Engelsburg, Forsten, Oberlangenbach, Niederlangenbach, Karlsruhe, Sonnenschein, Buchholzen, Bornefeld and Bergisch Born;\n(g) in the cities K\u00f6ln and Bonn the municipalities on the right side of the river Rhine;\n(h) the city Leverkusen;\n(i) the Rheinisch-Bergische Kreis;\n(j) the Oberbergische Kreis.\u2019"}
