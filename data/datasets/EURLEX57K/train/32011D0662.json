It provides for emergency measures where it is evident that food or feed imported from a third country is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment, and that such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned.\n(2) Certain lots of fenugreek seeds from Egypt have been identified to be the causative agent of an outbreak in the EU, of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli bacteria (STEC), serotype O104:H4. Commission Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU of 6 July 2011 on emergency measures applicable to fenugreek seeds and certain seeds and beans imported from Egypt\u00a0(2) introduced a ban on imports of products of specific tax codes listed in the Annex.\n(3) From 21 August to 25 August 2011, the Commission\u2019s Food and Veterinary Office conducted an audit in Egypt in order to trace back the possible source of infection of the recent E. coli outbreaks (O104:H4 serotype) in the northern part of Germany and Bordeaux, France, and to evaluate the production and processing conditions of the suspect seeds.\n(4) While the findings of the audit and the actions being taken by Egypt are still under review, shortcomings were identified in the production of seeds for human consumption that may potentially be sprouted. The same shortcomings were however not present in the production sites of fresh leguminous vegetables for direct human consumption. In addition, since fresh or chilled leguminous vegetables are traded when seeds are not ripe yet, such seeds cannot be used for sprouting.\n(5) Fresh or chilled leguminous vegetables other than sprouts, imported from Egypt should no longer be considered as a food safety risk and be re-authorised for import. The emergency measures in Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU should therefore be reviewed based on this new information. The Annex to Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU should be amended accordingly.\n(6) Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU differentiates between mustard seeds for sowing and other mustard seeds under CN code 1207\u00a050. Since these seeds represent all seeds under code CN 1207\u00a050, the wording in Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU should be simplified. As well the sequence of the CN codes should be brought in line with the custom code nomenclature.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU shall be replaced with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 7.7.2011, p. 10.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nSeeds and beans for which import from Egypt is prohibited until 31 October 2011\nCN Code Description\nex\u00a00704\u00a090\u00a090 Rocket sprouts\nex\u00a00706\u00a090\u00a090 Beetroot sprouts, radish sprouts\nex\u00a00708 Sprouts of leguminous vegetables, fresh or chilled\nex\u00a00709\u00a090\u00a090 Soya bean sprouts\n0713 Dried leguminous vegetables, shelled, whether or not skinned or split\n0910\u00a099\u00a010 Fenugreek seed\n1201\u00a000 Soya beans, whether or not broken\n1207\u00a050 Mustard seeds\n1207\u00a099\u00a097 Other oil seeds and oleaginous fruits, whether or not broken\n1209\u00a010\u00a000 Sugar beet seed\n1209\u00a021\u00a000 Lucerne (alfalfa) seed\n1209\u00a091 Vegetable seeds\nex\u00a01214\u00a090\u00a090 Lucerne (alfalfa) sprouts\u2019"}
