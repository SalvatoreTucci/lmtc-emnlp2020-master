Under Article 6 of that Regulation, in 2008 and 2009 import quotas for rice originating in the states listed in Annex I thereto which form part of the Cariforum region are to be opened at zero duty for products of tariff heading 1006, with the exception of subheading 1006\u00a010\u00a010 for which imports are completely exempt from duties as of 1 January 2008.\n(2) Under Article 6 of Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC, ACP/OCTs cumulation of origin is allowed for a total annual quantity of 160\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes in husked-rice equivalent, for products falling within tariff heading 1006. Of that total quantity, an initial issue of import licences for 35\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes of rice originating in the overseas countries and territories (hereinafter 'OCTs) is made each year and, within this quantity, import licences for 10\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes are issued for imports originating in the least-developed OCTs. All other import licences are issued for imports originating in the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. These quantities may be increased if the ACP States do not actually use their direct export options under the 125\u00a0000\u00a0tonne tariff quota provided for in the Cotonou agreement.\n(3) Given that, from 1 January 2008, the trading arrangements of the Cotonou agreement no longer apply and the tariff quota for rice provided for therein is replaced by the preferential arrangements provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, it should be laid down that the quota of 35\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes reserved for the OCTs may be increased if imports of rice into the Community under the preferential arrangements provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 do not reach 125\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes.\n(4) To ensure that the import arrangements for rice provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 and by Decision 2001/822/EC are properly managed, the detailed rules for issuing import licences for rice originating in the Cariforum states and the OCTs in 2008 and 2009 should be laid down in a single text. Commission Regulation (EC) No 2021/2006 of 22 December 2006 opening and providing for the administration of import quotas for rice originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and the overseas countries and territories (OCTs) should therefore be repealed\u00a0(4).\n(5) Without prejudice to the additional conditions or relevant derogations laid down for the management of these import arrangements, account should be taken of the provisions of the horizontal or sectoral implementing regulations, that is, Commission Regulations (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(5), (EC) No 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice\u00a0(6), and (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(7).\n(6) To ensure balanced market management, the issue of import licences relating to the above import quotas is to be staggered over the year in several specific subperiods and the period of validity of the licences should be laid down.\n(7) Quantities of rice at stages of processing other than husked rice shall be converted at the rates laid down in Article 1 of Commission Regulation No 467/67/EEC\u00a0(8). Provision should also be made for the conversion of quantities of broken rice.\n(8) In order to ensure proper administration of the quotas provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 and Decision 2001/822/EC, a security should be lodged in conjunction with an import licence application at a level commensurate with the risks involved.\n(9) Imports from the OCTs must be covered by import licences issued on the basis of an export licence issued by bodies authorised by the OCTs.\n(10) Licences not used to import rice originating in the least-developed OCTs should be made available for the import of rice originating in the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, without precluding the possibility of carrying quantities forward to subsequent subperiods in the year.\n(11) As the agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements enter into force from 1 January 2008, the measures provided for in this Regulation should apply from the same date.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zero-duty annual import tariff quotas are hereby opened on 1 January for products falling within CN code 1006, with the exception of CN code 1006\u00a010\u00a010, originating in the states which are part of the Cariforum region, as referred to in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, under the following references:\n(a) 187\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes under serial number 09.4219 for 2008;\n(b) 250\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes under serial number 09.4220 for 2009.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zero-duty annual import tariff quotas for a total quantity of 35\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes of rice originating in the OCTs or with ACP/OCTs cumulation of origin are hereby opened on 1 January 2008 and 2009 for products falling within CN code 1006 in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 6(5) of Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC, under the following references:\n(a) 25\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes under serial number 09.4189 for the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba;\n(b) 10\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes under serial number 09.4190 for the least-developed OCTs referred to in Annex I B to Decision 2001/822/EC.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The import tariff quotas referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be divided into subperiods in accordance with Annex I hereto.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quotas referred to in paragraph 2 may be increased depending on the circumstances and within the limits provided for in Article 10(1) and (2) of this Regulation.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unless otherwise specified, the quantities indicated in this Regulation shall be expressed in husked-rice equivalent.\nQuantities of rice at stages of processing other than husked rice shall be converted at the rates laid down in Article 1 of Regulation No 467/67/EEC.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, quantities of broken rice shall be converted into quantities of husked rice on the basis of product weight.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000, 1342/2003 and 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\nCHAPTER II\nCOMMON IMPLEMENTING RULES", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licence applications required pursuant to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 shall be lodged with the competent authorities of the Member States in the first seven days of each subperiod.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity applied for in respect of each subperiod and quota serial number concerned shall not exceed 5\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes.
