The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 55,698   0,710 x1 + 0,198 x2\nwhere:\ny = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase, x1 = the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs, x2 = the thickness of muscle in  millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x1. The formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 150 kg.';\n(b) point 2 of Part 5 is replaced by the following:\n'2. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 44,864   0,552 G + 0,280 M\nwhere:\ny = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase, G = the minimum back fat thickness (including rind), measured at the site of the Gluteus medius muscle, M = the minimum thickness of the lumber muscle, measured between the anterior extremity of  the Gluteus medius muscle and the dorsal surface of the spinal canal. The formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kg.';\n(c) the following Part 6 is added:\n'PART 6\nCapteur Gras/Maigre-Sydel\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \"Capteur Gras/Maigre-Sydel\".\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a Sydel high-definition probe of 8 mm diameter containing an infra-red photodiode (Honeywell) and 2 photodetectors (Honeywell) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 95 mm.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the CGM itself.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 55,698   0,710 x1 + 0,198 x2\nwhere:\ny = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase, x1 = the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs, x2 = the thickness of muscle in  millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x1.
