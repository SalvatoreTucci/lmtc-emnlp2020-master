Article 25(1) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 allows the use of the Community logo in the labelling, presentation and advertising of products which satisfy the requirements set out under that Regulation.\n(2) Experience gained in the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(2), which has been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, has shown that the Community logo which could be used on a voluntary basis no longer meets the expectations of the operators in the sector nor of the consumers.\n(3) New rules concerning the logo should be introduced in Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 of 5 September 2008 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products with regard to organic production, labelling and control\u00a0(3). Those rules should allow that the logo is better adapted to the developments in the sector, in particular through better identification by the consumer of organic products falling under the EU regulations concerning the organic production.\n(4) Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it is appropriate to refer to \u2018organic production logo of the European Union\u2019 instead of \u2018Community organic production logo\u2019.\n(5) A competition was organised by the Commission amongst students of art and design from the Member States, with a view to gather proposals for a new logo, and an independent jury made a selection and ranking of the 10 best proposals. Further scrutiny from the point of view of the intellectual property allowed to identify the three best designs from that point of view, which were subsequently submitted to a consultation on the Internet opened from 7 December 2009 to 31 January 2010. The proposed logo chosen by a majority of visitors of the website over that period should be adopted as the new organic production logo of the European Union.\n(6) The change of the organic production logo of the European Union as from the 1 July 2010 should not cause difficulties on the market, and in particular it should be allowed that organic products which have been already placed on the market can be sold without the compulsory indications required by Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, provided that the products in question comply with Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 or Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.\n(7) In order to enable the use of the logo as soon as it is compulsory in accordance with the EU legislation and to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market, to guarantee fair competition and to protect consumer interests, the new organic production logo of the European Union was registered as an Organic Farming Collective Mark in the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property and is consequently in force, usable and protected. The logo will also be registered in the Community and International Registers.\n(8) Article 58 of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 lays down that the code number of the control body or authority should be placed immediately below the Community logo without specific indication about the format and the attribution of these codes. In order to establish a harmonised application of these code numbers, detailed rules about the format and the attribution of these codes should be set out.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee on Organic Production,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 is amended as follows:\n1. in Title III, the title of Chapter I is replaced by the following:\n2.

If a symbol is used in colour on a coloured background, which makes it difficult to see, a delimiting outer line around the symbol can be used to improve contrast with the background colours.\n6.

The Organic logo of the EU may be associated with graphical or textual elements referring to organic farming, under the condition that they do not modify or change the nature of the Organic logo of the EU, nor any of the indications mentioned at Article 58. When associated to national or private logos using a green colour different from the reference colour mentioned in point 2, the Organic logo of the EU may be used in that non-reference colour.\n9.
