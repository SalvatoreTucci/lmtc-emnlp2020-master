conditions relating thereto for certain fish stocks applicable in the Black Sea for 2009\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas\u00a0(2), and in particular Article 2 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the necessary measures governing access to areas and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries.\n(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the Council establishes the fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of those opportunities to Member States.\n(3) In order to ensure effective management of the fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established.\n(4) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions of relevance for the allocation of fishing opportunities.\n(5) In accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures provided for therein must be identified.\n(6) In order to contribute to the conservation of fish stocks, certain supplementary measures relating to the technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2009.\n(7) The reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) for sprat should not affect its future stock levels, which should take into account the fishing activities of other Black Sea coastal States.\n(8) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with Community legislation on the subject, in particular with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy\u00a0(3) and Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms\u00a0(4).\n(9) Bearing in mind that in one Member State, before the entry into force of this Regulation, nets with a mesh size inferior to 400\u00a0mm were traditionally used to catch turbot, and in order to allow adequate adaptation to the technical measures introduced in this Regulation, vessels flying the flag of that Member State shall be permitted to fish for turbot using nets with a minimum mesh size of no less than 360 mm.\n(10) In order to ensure proper enforcement and control, the mesh size should be measured in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 517/2008 of 10 June 2008 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 as regards the determination of the mesh size and assessing the thickness of twine of fishing nets\u00a0(5).\n(11) In view of the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nSUBJECT-MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS", "Subject-matter\nThis Regulation fixes fishing opportunities for the year 2009 for
