The effect of Directive 98/8/EC read in conjunction with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 of 4 November 2003 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market and amending Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000\u00a0(3), is that from 1 September 2006 the placing on the market and the use of biocidal products containing arsenic and arsenic compounds for wood preservation purposes is not possible unless those substances are authorised in accordance with Article 5(1) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(3) In order to ensure a coherent application of the legislation in question, it is therefore necessary to adapt the rules concerning biocidal products containing arsenic compounds in Directive 76/769/EEC to the rules in Directive 98/8/EC.\n(4) The rules concerning wood treated with arsenic compounds in Directive 76/769/EEC do not adequately distinguish between the first placing on the market and the reuse of such wood. It is therefore necessary to clarify those rules and in particular the placing of such wood on the second hand market.\n(5) Directive 76/769/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the adaptation to technical progress of the Directives for the elimination of technical barriers to trade in dangerous substances and preparations,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30 June 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
