In this context, sampling should be broadly construed as covering all the methods of compliance verification set out in Article 6(1a)(a), (b) and (c) of that Directive.\n(4) Physical sampling of marine fuel being used for the purpose of verifying compliance should be carried out either through obtaining and analysing a fuel spot sample from the ship's fuel service system, or by analysing the relevant sealed bunker samples on board.\n(5) The frequency of sampling should be determined on the basis of the number of individual ships calling in a Member State, the verification of ship documentation, the use of alternative targeting technologies to ensure a fair share of burden among Member States and cost-effectiveness as well as specific alerts about individual ships.\n(6) The sampling of marine fuels while being delivered to ships should be targeted on marine fuel suppliers which have been repeatedly found not to comply with the specification stated on the bunker delivery note, taking into account the volume of marine fuels marketed by the supplier.\n(7) In order to implement Directive 1999/32/EC in a cost-effective manner, Member States should be encouraged to comply with the sampling frequency by selecting ships for fuel compliance verification on the basis of national risk-based targeting mechanisms or the use of innovative compliance verification technologies, and to share the collected information with other Members States.\n(8) A dedicated Union information system, developed and operated by the European Maritime Safety Agency, available to Member States from 1 January 2015, is to serve as a platform to record and exchange information on the results of individual compliance verifications under Directive 1999/32/EC. Member States should be encouraged to use the system, that can significantly contribute towards rationalising and optimising the assessment of the compliance with the requirements of that Directive.\n(9) In order not to impose a disproportionate administrative burden on Member States without a coast line, on ships flying their flag or on their marine fuel suppliers, certain provisions should not apply to those Member States.\n(10) Reporting should take into account the best use of all available and state-of-the-art technologies so that the administrative burden is kept to a minimum, while leaving flexibility to those Member States which might prefer to report in a more traditional way. Therefore, Member States have the possibility to use the Union information system to fulfil the relevant annual reporting obligations under Directive 1999/32/EC.\n(11) Not earlier than 1 January 2016, and subject to the availability of common shared data regarding sulphur compliance verifications and sampling, Member States may use the risk-based targeting mechanism integrated into the Union information system to prioritise ship fuel verification in a cost-effective manner.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 9(1) of Directive 1999/32/EC,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Decision lays down the rules concerning sampling methods and frequency as well as reporting under Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulphur content of marine fuels.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018Service tank\u2019 means a tank from where fuel is taken to feed the downstream fuel-oil combustion machinery;\n(2) \u2018Fuel service system\u2019 means the system supporting the distribution, filtration, purification and supply of fuel from the service tanks to the fuel-oil combustion machinery;\n(3) \u2018Ship's representative\u2019 means the ship's master or officer in charge who is responsible for the marine fuels being used, documentation and for agreeing on the alternative fuel sampling point location;\n(4) \u2018Sulphur inspector\u2019 means a person duly authorised by the competent authority of a Member State to verify compliance with the provisions of Directive 1999/32/EC;\n(5) \u2018Union information system\u2019 means a system using the port call data of individual ships within SafeSeaNet, the information management system established by Article 22a of Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) ('SafeSeaNet'), to record and exchange information on the results of individual compliance verifications under Directive 1999/32/EC, and operated by the European Maritime Safety Agency. A Union risk-based targeting mechanism is developed on the basis of those results of individual compliance verifications and associated findings under Directive 1999/32/EC.", "Frequency of sampling of

basis of national risk-based targeting mechanisms and of specific alerts on individual ships reported in the Union information system.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The number of individual ships calculated pursuant to paragraph 2 that shall also be checked by sampling or analysis or both can be adjusted, but not reduced by more than 50 %, either:\n(a) by subtracting the number of individual ships for which possible non-compliance is verified using remote sensing technologies or quick scan analysing methods; or\n(b) by setting an appropriate number where document verifications in accordance with paragraph 1 are carried out on board of at least 40 % of the individual ships calling in the relevant Member State per year.\nThe adjustment referred to in points (a) and (b) shall be reported in the Union information system.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As from 1 January 2016, instead of complying with the annual frequency laid down in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, a Member State may apply an annual frequency

inspector.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may take a spot sample at more than one location in the fuel service system to determine whether there is a possible fuel cross-contamination in the absence of fully segregated fuel service systems, or in case of multiple service tank arrangements.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that the spot sample is collected in a sampling container from which at least three sample bottles can be filled which are representative of the marine fuel being used.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall take measures to ensure the following:\n(a) that the sample bottles are sealed by the sulphur inspector with a unique means of identification installed in the presence of the ship's representative;\n(b) that two sample bottles
