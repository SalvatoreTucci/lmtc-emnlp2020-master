In addition, in order to ensure maximum flexibility for imports of tobacco-based products into the Canary Islands, it should be permitted for the overall quantity of stripped raw tobacco to be used for imports of other products, on the basis of a coefficient of equivalence, in the light of the requirements of the local industry.\n(3) For the purposes of managing this arrangement, in the interests of simplicity and administrative uniformity, Commission Regulation (EC) No 20/2002 of 28 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing the specific supply arrangements for the outermost regions introduced by Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 474/2002(5), should be applied wherever possible.\n(4) In the interests of legal clarity, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2179/92 of 30 July 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of the specific import measures for the Canary Islands as regards tobacco(6) should be repealed.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2179/92 provides that the annual quota of 20000 tonnes is to be managed on the basis of the period from 1 July of a given year to 30 June of the following year. To harmonise this with the specific supply arrangements, the period for managing the scheme should be amended and the quantity should be made available on a calendar year basis. For the purposes of applying the scheme during the transitional period from 1 July to 31 December 2002, the maximum quantity available referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 should be set at 10000 tonnes.\n(6) The CN code for cigarette rag has been amended.
