In the interests of clarity, Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 should be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(3) The provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1674/72 of 2 August 1972 laying down general rules for granting and financing aid for seed\u00a0(5) were incorporated into the implementing rules in Chapter 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 of 29 October 2004 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as regards the support schemes provided for in Titles IV and IVa of that Regulation and the use of land set aside for the production of raw materials\u00a0(6). Regulation (EEC) No 1674/72 should therefore be repealed.\n(4) In order to monitor the volume of trade in seeds with third countries, provision should be made for an import licence scheme with the lodging of a security to ensure that the transactions for which such licences are requested are effected.\n(5) The system of customs duties makes it possible to dispense with all other protective measures in the case of goods imported from third countries.\n(6) The internal market and customs duty mechanism could, in exceptional circumstances, prove inadequate. In such cases, in order not to leave the Community market without defence against disturbances that might ensue, the Community should be able to take all necessary measures without delay. Those measures should comply with the Community\u2019s international obligations.\n(7) The proper working of the internal market in seeds would be jeopardised by the granting of national aid. The provisions of the Treaty governing State aid should, therefore, apply to the products covered by this common market organisation. However, since accession, Finland may, subject to authorisation by the Commission, grant aid respectively for certain quantities of seeds and for certain quantities of cereal seed produced solely in Finland, because of its specific climatic conditions.\n(8) Since the common market in seeds is constantly evolving, the Member States and the Commission should keep each other supplied with information relevant to developments in this area.\n(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(7),", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS", "A common organisation of the market in seeds shall be established and shall cover the following products:\nCN code Description of goods\n0712\u00a090\u00a011 Sweetcorn hybrids for sowing\n0713\u00a010\u00a010 Peas (Pisum sativum) for sowing\nex\u00a00713\u00a020\u00a000 Chickpeas for sowing\nex\u00a00713\u00a031\u00a000 Beans of the species Vigna mungo (L.)
