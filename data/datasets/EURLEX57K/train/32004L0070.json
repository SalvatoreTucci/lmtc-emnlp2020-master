However, Annex II in principle only takes into account adaptations to acts adopted before the cut-off date for the accession negotiations, i.e. 1 November 2002.\n(2) It is however necessary to make additional adaptations to the acquis, in particular to acts adopted after that date as well as to acts which could not be included in Annex II or which, because of changed circumstances, require new adaptations.\n(3) Directive 2000/29/EC was amended at several occasions after 1 November 2002 in respect of certain provisions that were adapted by the Act of Accession of 2003.\n(4) By the Act of Accession of 2003, Lithuania was granted the status of a protected zone as regards Beet necrotic yellow vein virus for a limited period of time expiring on 31 March 2006. It is appropriate to amend the text of Annex IV to reflect the changes made by the Act of Accession.\n(5) By the Act of Accession of 2003, Latvia, Slovenia and Slovakia were granted the status of a protected zone as regards Globodera pallida (Stone) Behrens for a limited period of time expiring on 31 March 2006. It is appropriate to amend the text of Annex IV to reflect the changes made by the Act of Accession.\n(6) By the Act of Accession of 2003, Malta was granted the status of a protected zone as regards Citrus tristeza virus (European strains) for a limited period of time expiring on 31 March 2006. It is appropriate to amend the text of Annex IV to reflect the changes made by the Act of Accession.\n(7) In the interest of clarity it is appropriate to combine in one text some of the amendments made since 1 November 2002. An appropriate period should be given for the Member States to implement those provisions of this Directive which do not reflect existing legislation.\n(8) Directive 2000/29/EC should, therefore, be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 2000/29/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
