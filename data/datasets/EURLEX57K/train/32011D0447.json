However, the Annex to that Decision erroneously identified that amount to be charged to budget item 6701\u2018Clearance of EAGF accounts \u2014 assigned revenue\u2019. Rather, as that correction concerned the expenditures under the Temporary Rural Development Instrument (TRDI), it should have been charged to budget item 6500\u2018Financial corrections in connection with the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund and the European Fisheries Fund\u2019.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD\u00a0(4), sums excluded from Union financing are deducted from the monthly payments relating to the expenditure effected in the second month following the Decision with respect to the EAGF. Therefore, the amount of PLN\u00a0180\u00a0448\u00a0032,62 was converted into euro applying the exchange rate of 29 April 2010, amounting to EUR\u00a046\u00a0087\u00a0919,86.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 27/2004 of 5 January 2004 laying down transitional detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 as regards the financing by the EAGGF Guarantee Section of rural development measures in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia\u00a0(5), Commission decisions concerning rural development in Poland are to be expressed in euro. The corrections concerning TRDI which are expressed in the national currencies in the decisions should therefore be converted into euro. The conversion is made using the average exchange rate of the financial year of TRDI expenditure subject to correction. Following this methodology the amount of PLN\u00a0180\u00a0448\u00a0032,62 being a correction for TRDI expenses in the financial years 2005, 2006 and 2007 amounts to EUR\u00a046\u00a0430\u00a0682,69.\n(4) Decision 2010/152/EU should therefore be corrected accordingly,", "main_body": ["All entries in the Annex to Decision 2010/152/EU concerning Poland shall be replaced by those set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "For bookkeeping reasons, Poland shall declare the amount of EUR\u00a046\u00a0087\u00a0919,86 for reimbursement on budget item 6701\u2018Clearance of EAGF accounts \u2014 assigned revenue\u2019.\nA recovery order with the amount of EUR\u00a046\u00a0430\u00a0682,69 shall be issued by the Commission in order to execute the financial corrections concerning TRDI from budget item 6500\u2018Financial corrections in connection with the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund and the European Fisheries Fund\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Poland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nDacian CIOLO\u015e\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 103.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 209, 11.8.2005, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 63, 12.3.2010, p. 7.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 171, 23.6.2006, p. 90.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 5, 9.1.2004, p. 36.\nANNEX\nBUDGET ITEM 6701\nMS Measure FY Reason for correction Type % Currency Amount Deductions already made Financial impact\n\u2018PL Direct payments 2006 Land parcel system not completely vectorised.
