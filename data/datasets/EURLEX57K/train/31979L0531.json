MONORY  (1)OJ No C 212, 6.9.1978, p. 7. (2)OJ No C 93, 9.4.1979, p. 72. (3)Opinion delivered on 4 and 5 April 1979 (not yet published in the Official Journal). (4)See page 1 of this Official Journal.\nANNEX I\n1. All the provisions of Directive 79/530/EEC shall apply to labels for electric ovens.\n2.1. The manufacturers or importers will be responsible for measuring energy consumption and establishing the supplementary information set out below, in accordance with the methods of measurement referred to in CENELEC harmonization document HD 376 of October 1978, excluding paragraphs 3.2, 4.2 and 7.\n2.2. With regard to checking the accuracy of the label:      2.2.1. The measurement carried out on an appliance conforming to the manufacturing specifications and chosen at random amongst appliances of the same type must not diverge by more than 15 % from the information given on the label.\n2.2.2. If it does, a further check must be carried out on three appliances conforming to the manufacturing specifications and chosen at random amongst appliances of the same type.\n2.2.3. If the mean of the checks carried out on these three appliances reveals a divergence of more than 10 % from the information given on the label, the manufacturer or importer must circulate only amended labels unless further measurements, carried out at the request of the manufacturer in the presence of a representative of the body designated by the Member State to carry out checks, result in a mean which does not diverge by more than 10 % from the information given on the label.\n3. Information specific to electric ovens will be provided in the box reserved for that purpose. It will comprise the designation of the type of appliance, the usable volume, the preheat consumption to 200 \u00baC, the steady state consumption for one hour at 200 \u00baC, the total consumption, the consumption of the cleaning cycle, if any, (as soon as a method has been approved for this) and the reference of the standards used in measuring these data. Univers 65 type will be used in accordance with the examples in Annexes II (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f).        3.1. These data will be expressed in the following terms in the various languages:          3.1.1. Type of appliance\n\"Elbageovn\", in Danish (DK),\n\"Elektrobackofen\", in German (D),\n\"Electric oven\", in English (E),\n\"Four \u00e9lectrique\", in French (F),\n\"Forno elettrico\", in Italian (I),\n\"Elektrische oven\", in Dutch (NL).\nThese words will be followed by the make and model.\n3.1.2. A continuous horizontal line will separate this information from the following.\n3.1.3. Volume\nNyttevolumen (DK),\nNutzvolumen (D),\nUsable volume (E),\nVolume utilisable (F),\nVolume utilizzabile (I),\nBruikbaar volume (NL).\nThis quantity will be expressed in litres.\n3.1.4. A continuous horizontal line will separate this information from the following:\n3.1.5. Energy consumption            3.1.5.1. Energiforbrug ved opvarmning til 200 \u00baC (DK),\nEnergieverbrauch f\u00fcr Aufheizen auf 200 \u00baC (D),\nPreheat consumption to 200 \u00baC (E),\nConsommation de mont\u00e9e \u00e0 200 \u00baC (F),\nConsumo per raggiungere i 200 \u00baC (I),\nVerbruik om 200 \u00baC te bereiken (NL).\nThis quantity will be expressed in kWh.\nEnergiforbrug til opretholdelse af 200 \u00baC i \u00e9n time (DK),\nEnergieverbrauch f\u00fcr einst\u00fcndige Temperaturhaltung auf 200 \u00baC (D),\nSteady state consumption (one hour at 200 \u00baC) (E),\nConsommation de maintien pendant une heure \u00e0 200 \u00baC (F),\nConsumo per mantenere per un ora i 200 \u00baC (I),\nVerbruik om gedurende een uur 200 \u00baC te handhaven (NL).\nThis quantity will be expressed in kWh.\nThe total of these two quantities will be shown immediately below these data. A line as wide as the figures and the abbreviation of the unit will separate this total from what precedes. The total will be preceded by the word:\nI ALT (DK),\nINSGES. (D),\nTOTAL (E),\nTOTAL (F),\nTOTALE (I),\nTOTAAL (NL).\n3.1.5.2. A continuous horizontal line will separate this information from the following:\n3.1.5.3.

A continuous horizontal line will separate this information from the following:\n3.1.7. Standard\nThe standard used will be shown across the whole width of the box by the reference \"CENELEC HD 376\".\n3.1.8. The title of the information will be contained in a column extending from the left-hand margin of the box up to 30 mm from the right-hand margin. The data will be contained in a column extending from 30 mm to the left of the right-hand margin of the box to that margin.\n3.1.9. The titles will be in Univers 65 type.\n3.1.10. A 20 % tolerance will be permitted for the abovementioned dimensions.\nANNEX II (a)\n>PIC FILE= \"T0015011\">\nANNEX II (b)\n>PIC FILE= \"T0015012\">\nANNEX II (c)\n>PIC FILE= \"T0015013\">\nANNEX II (d)\n>PIC FILE= \"T0015014\">\nANNEX II (e)\n>PIC FILE= \"T0015015\">\nANNEX II (f)\n>PIC FILE= \"T0015016\">"}
