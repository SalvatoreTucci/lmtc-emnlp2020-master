That provision added a point to Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 79/373/EEC, requiring manufacturers of compound animal feedingstuffs to indicate, at the customer's request, the exact composition of a feedingstuff.\n(2) The Court of Justice of the European Communities, in its judgment of 6\u00a0December 2005 in Joined Cases C-453/03, C-11/04, C-12/04 and C-194/04\u00a0(5), declared Article\u00a01(1)(b) of Directive 2002/2/EC invalid, in the light of the principle of proportionality.\n(3) Article\u00a0233 of the Treaty requires the institutions whose act has been declared void to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice.\n(4) The objective of ensuring feed safety is achieved, inter alia, through implementation of the provisions of Regulations (EC) No\u00a0178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6) and (EC) No\u00a0183/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(7).\n(5) A number of court rulings in the Member States have led to Directive 2002/2/EC being implemented differently and unevenly and various cases relating to it are currently pending before the respective national courts.\n(6) The European Parliament and the Council are not at present making more far-reaching amendments to the basic legal act, since the Commission has promised, as part of a simplification programme, to draw up by mid-2007 proposals to overhaul feed legislation. They anticipate that the issue of the so-called \u2018open declaration\u2019 of ingredients will be fully reviewed in this context, and expect new proposals from the Commission taking account of both the interest of farmers in being provided with precise, detailed information on the feed materials contained in feedingstuffs and the interest of the industry in ensuring that business secrets are adequately protected.\n(7) The second subparagraph of Article\u00a012 of Directive 79/373/EEC, inserted by Article\u00a01(5) of Directive 2002/2/EC, provides for an obligation on manufacturers of compound feedingstuffs to make available to the authorities responsible for carrying out official inspections, on request, any document concerning the composition of feedingstuffs intended to be put into circulation which enables the accuracy of the information given by the labelling to be verified.\n(8) Directive 2002/2/EC should therefore be amended,", "main_body": ["Directive 2002/2/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
