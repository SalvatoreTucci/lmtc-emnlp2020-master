In addition, it provides that appropriate transitional measures may be adopted.\n(2) In view of the strict nature of those requirements, it is necessary to provide for transitional measures for Germany and Austria in order to allow industry sufficient time to adjust. In addition, alternative collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and uses for animal by-products need to be further developed as well as disposal methods for those by-products.\n(3) In particular the European Parliament has requested transitional measures on category 3 catering waste.\n(4) Accordingly, as a temporary measure a derogation should be granted to Germany and Austria to enable them to authorise operators to continue to apply national rules to category 3 catering waste in feed for pigs, taking into account the findings of Commission mission visits to Germany and Austria.\n(5) According to the definition of \"catering waste\" in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, waste from retail outlets such as supermarkets or food factories that are producing products for retail sale is not \"catering waste\" and therefore should not be covered by the derogation provided for in this Decision.\n(6) In order to prevent a risk to animal and public health appropriate control systems should be maintained in Germany and Austria for the period of the transitional measures.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Derogations regarding category 3 catering waste in feed for pigs and the intra-species-recycling ban on feeding swill to pigs\nPursuant to Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 and by way of derogation from point (a) and (b) of Article 22(1) of that Regulation, Germany and Austria may continue to grant individual approvals until 31 October 2006 at the latest to operators of premises and facilities in conformity with national rules, to apply such rules and the rules provided for in the present Decision for the use of Category 3 catering waste in feed for pigs, provided that:\n(a) the category 3 catering waste originates exclusively in restaurants, catering facilities and kitchens, including central kitchens and household kitchens in the Member States concerned;\n(b) the category 3 catering waste is intended exclusively for the production of processed catering waste (swill) for feeding to pigs in the two Member States concerned, and no trade in category 3 catering waste or swill derived therefrom takes place;\n(c) the national rules shall include at least the conditions of use provided for in the Annex to this Decision;\n(d) no unprocessed or processed category 3 catering waste shall be fed to feral pigs and to farmed wild boars; and\n(e) those operators were operating in conformity with national rules on 1 November 2002.", "Control measures\nThe competent authority shall take the necessary measures to control compliance by authorised operators of premises and facilities with the conditions set out in Article 1 and in the Annex.", "Withdrawal of approvals and disposal of material not complying with this Decision\n1.
