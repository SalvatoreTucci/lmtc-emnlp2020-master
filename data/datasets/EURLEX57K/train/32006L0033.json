There is scientific evidence that under certain circumstances, Sudan I (1-(phenylazo)-2-naphthalenol) may be formed as an impurity during the production of sunset yellow. Sudan I is an unauthorised colour and an undesired substance in food. Its presence in sunset yellow should therefore be restricted to an amount below the limit of detection, i.e. 0,5\u00a0mg/kg. The purity criteria for sunset yellow FCF (E 110) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(3) Account should be taken of the specifications and analytical techniques for additives set out in the Codex Alimentarius as drafted by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). JECFA began the implementation of a systematic programme to replace the test for heavy metals (as lead) in all existing food additive specifications with appropriate limits for individual metals of concern. These limits for sunset yellow FCF (E 110) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Titanium dioxide (E 171) is authorised under Directive 94/36/EC as a colour for use in certain foodstuffs. Titanium dioxide can be manufactured to obtain crystals in the anatase or in the rutile form. The platelet form of rutile titanium dioxide differs from the anatase form in structure and optical properties (pearlescence). There is a technological need for the use of the platelet form of rutile titanium dioxide as a colour in foodstuffs and in film coatings for food supplement tablets. On 7 December 2004 the European Food Safety Authority stated that the use of rutile titanium dioxide in the platelet or amorphous forms would not pose any safety concerns. The purity criteria for titanium dioxide (E 171) should therefore be amended in order to include both the anatase and the rutile form of the substance.\n(5) Directive 95/45/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 95/45/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 10 April 2007 at the latest.
