Sidinge Fjord was the first area to be drained in the Lammefjord region (starting in 1841), followed by Svinninge Vejle. The reclaiming of the largest area, the Lammefjord, started in 1873. Klints\u00f8 was the last area to be drained.\nThe subsoil consists of clay and marl or silty sand topped by a layer of silt several metres thick formed from vegetable and animal substances. Large areas of Lammefjord are more or less free of stones and the large numbers of old mussel and oyster shells give the soil a naturally high calcium content.\nWith its mild winters, cool summers and rainfall that is evenly distributed throughout the year, Lammefjord has an ideal carrot-growing climate.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nCarrots from the Lammefjord region have a very smooth surface and retain their colour after washing and during storage. They retain their colour as the sand in the soil has been polished and is smoother and rounder than in classic sandy soils, which means that the carrots do not have cracks in them when they are harvested. Carrots from the Lammefjord region can therefore be refrigerated and handled at all times of the year without causing surface discoloration.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe specific quality of \u2018Lammefjordsgulerod\u2019 carrots is related to the growing conditions provided by the former bed of the fjord. The special soil conditions allow gentle handling of the carrots, which have a smooth surface as a result.\nThe name \u2018Lammefjordsgulerod\u2019 is known throughout Denmark.\n\u2018Lammefjordsgulerod\u2019 carrots are one of the reasons why the general public associates Lammefjord with high-quality vegetables, and carrots in particular. \u2018Den store danske Encyklop\u00e6di\u2019 describes Lammefjord as follows: \u2018The drained fjord bed is highly fertile, producing cereals, seeds and vegetables. Lammefjord is known for its carrots and potatoes. Until 1980 it also had a reputation for flower bulbs and asparagus\u2019.\nLammefjord is often mentioned in reports in Danish and foreign media of the success enjoyed in those years by Danish restaurants with their menus based on Nordic ingredients.\nReference to publication of the specification\n[Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006]\nhttp://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/SiteCollectionDocuments/F\u00f8devarekvalitet/BGB-Lammefjordsguler\u00f8dder%20konsolideret.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
