1991)\nThe main objectives of European collaboration in medical and health research are to:\n- increase the scientific efficiency of the relevant research and development efforts in the Member States through their gradual coordination at Community level following the mobilization of the available research potential of national programmes, and also their economic efficiency through sharing of tasks and strengthening the joint use of available health research resources,\n- improve scientific and technical knowledge in the research and development areas selected for their importance to all Member States, and promote its efficient transfer into practical applications, taking particular account of potential industrial and economic developments in the areas concerned,\n- optimize the capacity and economic efficiency of health care efforts throughout the countries and regions of the Community.\nand, more specifically, to:\n- obtain, through coordination of similar projects in Member States, results from a larger sample more quickly and with a higher degree of confidence,\n- harmonize, through coordination of initially differing projects, their methodologies so that their results may be compared directly,\n- produce benefits in health care more quickly through dissemination of information and results, and through making knowledge of developments in medical technology more widely available.\nThe Commission will also establish the specific objectives for individual projects in concertation with the Committee referred to in Article 3.\nProgramme scheme\nSUBPROGRAMME I: MAJOR
