This ban has resulted in market disturbances with significant price falls due to the fact that an important export market has suddenly become unavailable.\n(2) Article 12(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that public intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder shall be available from 1 March to 30 September.\n(3) A situation has therefore arisen in which the normal measures available under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 appear to be insufficient to address the market disturbance.\n(4) The public intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder has been extended to 31 December 2014 by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 949/2014\u00a0(2).\n(5) Prices of butter and skimmed milk powder in the Union have further deteriorated and downward pressure is likely to carry on.\n(6) In order to cater for a situation where prices would further deteriorate and market disturbances would deepen, it is essential that public intervention is also available after 31 December 2014.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to fix the start of the intervention buying-in period for butter and skimmed milk powder in 2015 at 1 January.\n(8) In order to have an immediate impact on the market and to contribute to stabilise prices, the temporary measure provided for in this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 12(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, in 2015 public intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder shall be available from 1 January to 30 September.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0347, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a0671.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 949/2014 of 4 September 2014 laying down temporary exceptional measures for the milk and milk product sector in the form of extending the public intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder in 2014 (OJ L\u00a0265, 5.9.2014, p.\u00a021)."}
