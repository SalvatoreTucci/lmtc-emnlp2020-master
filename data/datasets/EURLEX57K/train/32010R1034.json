As a general rule, all animals on a holding should be covered by the checks. However, for holdings with more than 20 animals the competent authority should be permitted to restrict the checks to an appropriate representative sample of the animals.\n(3) In addition, Regulation (EC) No 1082/2003 provides that Member States are to submit an annual report to the Commission, in accordance with the model set out in Annex I thereto, giving details of the implementation of those controls.\n(4) The collection of the data for the annual report should be adequate and proportionate to the objectives pursued. For the sake of a more targeted and proportionate reporting, certain requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1082/2003, as well as the model set out in Annex I thereto, should be simplified to better provide with the relevant information of the implementation of the controls.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1082/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1082/2003 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 2, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 3 is replaced by the following:\n(3) in Article 5(1), point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) the number of holdings that have been checked;\u2019;\n(4) Annex I is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 November 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 204, 11.8.2000, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 156, 25.6.2003, p. 9.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 280, 12.10.2006, p. 3.\nANNEX\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 1082/2003 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ANNEX I\nReport on the results of checks carried out in accordance with Title I of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General information on holdings and animals\nTotal number of holdings in the Member State at the beginning of the reporting period\u00a0(1)\nTotal number of holdings checked during the reporting period\nTotal number of animals registered in the Member State at the beginning of the reporting period\u00a0(1)\nTotal number of animals checked in holdings during the reporting period\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-Compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000\nHoldings with non-compliance\nSanctions imposed in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 494/98\u00a0(2)\nAffected animals Affected holdings\n1.
