Those lists are to be revised every two years.\n(3) The guidelines referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 are set out in Part B of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 501/2008.\n(4) In the context of the crisis in the sheep meat sector and with a view to raising awareness in relation to sheep meat and its production and consumption, trade and inter-trade organisations from the sector should be given the opportunity to receive Union co-financing for information and promotion programmes for generic sheep meat of Union origin.\n(5) Optional quality terms, introduced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(3), constitute the second tier of quality systems which add value. They can be communicated on the internal market and refer to specific horizontal characteristics, with regard to one or more categories of products, farming methods or processing attributes which apply in specific areas. In order to complete the availability of promotion programmes on the internal market for all current quality schemes,products covered by the scheme for optional quality terms should be included as an eligible product, together with products covered by the schemes for protected designations of origin (PDO), protected geographical indications (PGI) or traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG).\n(6) The reasons for granting the eligibility to poultrymeat are no longer valid, as the period following the avian influenza crisis has been sufficiently long for restoring consumer confidence. Therefore, references to poultrymeat should be deleted.\n(7) In selecting third countries for inclusion in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 501/2008, account is to be taken of the markets of third countries where there is actual or potential demand. Due to steadily growing consumption, potential for and interest in Union agricultural products as well as further outreach of Union programmes and cooperation projects, new countries and areas should be considered as eligible markets for the promotional programmes.\n(8) In the context of the accession of Croatia to the Union on 1 July 2013, that country should be removed from the list of eligible third countries.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III to Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 3, 5.1.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 6.6.2008, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 14.12.2012, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnexes I, II and III to Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 are amended as follows:\n(1) Annex I is amended as follows:\n(a) Part A. \u2018List of themes and products\u2019 is amended as follows:\n(i) the 13th indent is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 Products covered by the schemes for protected designations of origin (PDO), protected geographical indications (PGI), traditional specialties guaranteed (TSG) or optional quality terms in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(1)\n(ii) the 15th indent is deleted\n(iii) the following indent is added:\n\u2018\u2014 Sheep meat\u2019\n(b) Part B. \u2018Guidelines\u2019 is amended as follows:\n(i) in the guidelines on \u2018FRESH, CHILLED OR FROZEN MEAT, PRODUCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A COMMUNITY OR NATIONAL QUALITY SCHEME\u2019, in point 2. \u2018Goals\u2019, the words \u2018PDO/PGI/TSG and organic farming\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018PDO/PGI/TSG, optional quality terms and organic farming\u2019\n(ii) the guidelines on \u2018PRODUCTS WITH A PROTECTED DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN (PDO), A PROTECTED GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATION (PGI) OR TRADITIONAL SPECIALITY GUARANTEED (TSG)\u2019 are replaced by the following:\n\u2014 provide comprehensive information on the content, the operation and the Union nature of the schemes and, in particular, on their effects on the commercial value of the products with protected names or optional quality terms which after registration benefit from the protection granted by those schemes,\n\u2014 enhance knowledge of the Union symbols for products covered by the schemes for PDO/PGI/TSG or optional quality terms among consumers, distributors and food professionals,\n\u2014 encourage producer/processor groups not yet taking part in those schemes to register the names of products which satisfy the basic requirements and to apply optional quality terms,\n\u2014 encourage producers and processors in the regions concerned but not yet taking part in the schemes to participate in the production of the products bearing the registered names by conforming to the approved specifications and inspection requirements laid down for the various protected names,\n\u2014 stimulate demand for the products concerned by informing consumers and distributors of the existence, significance and benefits of the schemes, and of the logos, the criteria for awarding designations, the relevant checks and controls, and the traceability system.\n\u2014 Producers and processors\n\u2014 Distributors (supermarkets, wholesalers, retailers, caterers, canteens, restaurants)\n\u2014 Consumers and consumer associations\n\u2014 Opinion multipliers\n\u2014 The products bearing the protected names have specific characteristics associated with their geographical origin; in the case of products with a PDO, the quality or characteristics of the products are essentially or exclusively linked to the particular geographical environment with its inherent natural and human factors.
