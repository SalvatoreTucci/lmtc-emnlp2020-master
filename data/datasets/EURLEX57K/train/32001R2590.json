This states that that establishment has the necessary staff, equipment and facilities to carry out checks, that is uses methods equivalent to those referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 and that the fresh fruit and vegetables exported from Switzerland to the Community must meet the Community marketing standards.\n(3) The information sent by the Member States and in the possession of the Commission shows that, in the period 1997 to 2000, imports of fresh fruit and vegetables from Switzerland presented a relatively low incidence of non-conformity with the marketing standards.\n(4) For a number of years the Swiss inspection bodies, and their supervisory authorities, have been regular participants in international efforts to agree trading standards for fruit and vegetables, such as the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the OECD Scheme for the Application of International Standards for Fruit and Vegetables.\n(5) Imports of fresh fruit and vegetables by Switzerland from the Community are not subject to a quality check prior to release for free circulation on the Swiss market.\n(6) Annex 10 to the Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation stipulates that the controls performed under the responsibility of the Office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de l'agriculture are to be recognised by the Community, including those on products originating in the Community and re-exported from Switzerland into the Community. The relevant provisions of that Agreement should be implemented before they become applicable and consequently a derogation should be granted from Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 as regards the origin of eligible products.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["1. Checks on conformity to the marketing standards carried out by Switzerland on fresh fruit and vegetables from Switzerland shall be approved in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001.\n2.
