A differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy was applied by using a heterologous vaccine of H7N1 subtype, which allows differentiation between infected and vaccinated poultry.\n(2) Under Commission Decision 2004/666/EC of 29 September 2004 on introducing vaccination to supplement the measures to control infections with low pathogenic avian influenza in Italy and on specific movement control measures and repealing Decision 2002/975/EC\u00a0(6) a new vaccination programme was approved in a smaller area of Italy compared to the previous vaccination campaign under Decision 2002/975/EC. The new programme is carried out with a bivalent vaccine containing both avian influenza subtypes H5 and H7. This kind of vaccination is carried out until at least 31 December 2005. That Decision also provides for a prohibition on intra-Community trade in live poultry and hatching eggs coming from and/or originating from the vaccination area and conditions for intra-Community trade in fresh meat originating from vaccinated poultry in accordance with article 3 of Decision 2004/666/EC.\n(3) The results of the vaccination programme, as provided for in Decision 2004/666/EC and reported at several meetings of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, were generally favourable.\n(4) As a result of the favourable situation within the vaccination area provided for in Decision 2004/666/EC and in the light of the increased experience on the application of vaccination, dispatch of slaughter poultry, hatching eggs and day-old chicks from Italy should be permitted if certain conditions are fulfilled.\n(5) In the light of the particular risk of introduction of avian influenza in the areas of Italy in question, and the submission by Italy of an amended vaccination programme by the letter dated 23 June 2005 for approval, it appears appropriate to continue vaccination in the areas at higher risk of disease introduction. Furthermore, an intensive monitoring and surveillance should be performed both in the vaccination area and in its surroundings.\n(6) Special sampling and testing procedures should also be applicable to slaughter poultry.\n(7) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate to repeal Decision 2004/666/EC and replace it by this Decision.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Approval of the vaccination programme\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amended vaccination programme against avian influenza, submitted by Italy to the Commission on 23 June 2005, is approved (\u2018the vaccination programme\u2019).\nThe vaccination programme shall be carried out with a bivalent vaccine in the areas listed in Annex I (\u2018the vaccination area\u2019).
