The following paragraph 2a is inserted in Article 2:\n'2a. In the case of extra virgin olive oil, the offer may not be accepted until the intervention agency has checked that the organoleptic characteristics correspond to those defined in the Annex to Regulation No 136/66/EEC. This check must be carried out by an agency which has been approved by the Member State concerned and is independent of the storage and intervention agencies. The Member States concerned shall inform the Commission of the measures taken for this purpose.\nIn order to coordinate activities on a Community level, Commission officials may be present in the work of the agencies in question.\nIn the event of a Member State failing to approve such an agency, the Commission may, by decision, suspend the price increase for extra virgin olive oil in the Member State concerned.'\n3.
