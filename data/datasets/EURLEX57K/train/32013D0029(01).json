This adjustment requires the Governing Council to determine the terms and conditions for transfers of capital shares between the NCBs that are members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) on 31 December 2013 in order to ensure that the distribution of these shares corresponds to the adjustments made. Accordingly, the adoption of a new decision is required that repeals Decision ECB/2013/18 of 21 June 2013 laying down the terms and conditions for transfers of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital shares between the national central banks and for the adjustment of the paid-up capital\u00a0(2) with effect from 1 January 2014.\n(2) Decision ECB/2013/30 of 29 August 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro\u00a0(3) determines how and to what extent the NCBs of the Member States whose currency is the euro (hereinafter \u2018euro area NCBs\u2019) are under an obligation to pay up the ECB\u2019s capital in view of the adjusted capital key. Decision ECB/2013/31 of 30 August 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the non-euro area national central banks\u00a0(4) determines the percentage that the NCBs of the Member States whose currency is not the euro (hereinafter \u2018non-euro area NCBs\u2019) are under an obligation to pay up with effect from 1 January 2014 in view of the adjusted capital key.\n(3) The euro area NCBs, with the exception of Latvijas Banka, have already paid up their shares in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital as required under Decision ECB/2013/19 of 21 June 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro\u00a0(5). In view of this, Article 2(1) of Decision ECB/2013/30 states that euro area NCBs should either transfer an additional amount to the ECB, or receive an amount back from the ECB, as appropriate, in order to arrive at the amounts shown in the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/30.\n(4) Furthermore, a separate decision of the Governing Council on the paying-up of capital, transfer of foreign reserve assets and contributions by Latvijas Banka to the European Central Bank\u2019s reserves and provisions will lay down that Latvijas Banka, which will be a euro-area NCB from 1 January 2014, is under an obligation to pay up the remaining share of its subscription to the ECB\u2019s capital in order to arrive at the amount shown next to its name in the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/30, taking into account the adjusted capital key.\n(5) Likewise, the non-euro area NCBs have already paid up a percentage of their shares in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital as required under Decision ECB/2013/20 of 21 June 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the non-euro area national central banks\u00a0(6). In view of this, Article 2(1) of Decision ECB/2013/31 states that each of them should either transfer an additional amount to the ECB, or receive an amount back from the ECB, as appropriate, in order to arrive at the amounts shown in the third column of the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/31,", "main_body": ["Transfer of capital shares\nGiven the share in the ECB\u2019s capital that each NCB will have subscribed on 31 December 2013, and the share in the ECB\u2019s capital that each NCB will subscribe with effect from 1 January 2014 as a consequence of the adjustment of the capital key weightings laid down in Article 2 of Decision ECB/2013/28, the NCBs shall transfer capital shares among themselves via transfers to and from the ECB to ensure that the distribution of capital shares with effect from 1 January 2014 corresponds to the adjusted weightings. To this effect, each NCB shall, by virtue of this Article and without the need for any further formality or act, be deemed to have either transferred or received with effect from 1 January 2014 the share in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital shown next to its name in the fourth column of the table in Annex I to this Decision, whereby \u2018+\u2019 shall refer to a capital share that the ECB shall transfer to the NCB and \u2018\u2013\u2019 to a capital share that the NCB shall transfer to the ECB.", "Adjustment of the paid-up capital\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the amount of the ECB\u2019s capital that each NCB has paid up and the amount of the ECB\u2019s capital that each NCB shall pay up with effect from 1 January 2014 pursuant to Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/30 for the euro area NCBs and Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/31 for the non-euro area NCBs respectively, on the first operating day of the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system (TARGET2) following 1 January 2014 each NCB shall either transfer or receive the net amount shown next to its name in the fourth column of the table in Annex II to this Decision, whereby \u2018+\u2019 shall refer to an amount that the NCB shall transfer to the ECB and \u2018\u2013\u2019 to an amount that the ECB shall transfer to that NCB.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the first TARGET2 operating day following 1 January 2014, the ECB and the NCBs that are under an obligation to transfer an amount under paragraph 1 shall each separately transfer any interest on the respective amounts due accruing over the period from 1 January 2014 until the date of the transfer.
