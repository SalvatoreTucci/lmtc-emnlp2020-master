All operators must keep at the INAO\u2019s disposal their registers and any documents required for checking the origin, quality and production conditions of the milk and cheese.\nAs part of the checks carried out on the specified features of the designation of origin, an analytical and organoleptic test is conducted to ensure that the products submitted for examination are of high quality and possess the requisite typical characteristics.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe milk must be produced, and the cheese must be manufactured and matured within the geographical area.\nWhole goat\u2019s milk, with a small amount of rennet added, curdled by lactic acid. The fresh curd, pre-drained or not, is placed in a perforated mould in the shape of a truncated cone. It is left to drain for 18 to 24 hours, salted on the surface. It is then left to dry for a further 24 to 48 hours. Matured for at least 10 days at a temperature of 10 to 12\u00a0\u00b0C and 80 to 90\u00a0% humidity.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nThe name comes from the Arabic word \u2018chebli\u2019 meaning goat. The cheese was made by the Saracens who were defeated at Poitiers in 732 but remained in the area, confined to a hill nearby. The name \u2018Chabichou\u2019 appears in Charles de Cherge\u2019s 1782 \u2018Guide du voyageur \u00e0 Poitiers\u2019. It is associated with the Poitou region and its praises were sung in a sonnet by Emile Bergerat in 1910 and in a 1914 song. The designation was applied for in 1989 and the designation of origin obtained in 1990.\nChabichou du Poitou is produced in the Seuil du Poitou geological area: homogeneous limestone terrain, where goats have been reared for centuries and there is a long tradition of producing and processing this particular cheese.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName : Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 (INAO)\nAddress : 51 rue d'Anjou \u2014 75008 Paris \u2014 FRANCE\nTel. : +33 153898000\nFax : +33 153898060\ne-mail : info@inao.gouv.fr\nThe Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 is a public administrative body with legal personality and reports to the Ministry of Agriculture.\nName : Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r\u00e9pression des fraudes (DGCCRF)\nAddress : 59 boulevard Vincent-Auriol \u2014 75703 Paris Cedex 13 \u2014 FRANCE\nTel. : +33 144871717\nFax : + 33 144973037\nThe DGCCRF is a department of the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Employment.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling\nThe product must bear the wording \u2018Appellation d\u2019Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\u2019 and the name of the designation of origin.\nThe words \u2018Appellation d\u2019Origine\u2019 must appear on the label.\nThe words \u2018Fabrication fermi\u00e8re\u2019 or \u2018Fromage fermier\u2019 should also appear."}
