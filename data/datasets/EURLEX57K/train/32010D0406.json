The gap left by the non-availability of the 10th EDF will seriously reduce the capacity of the Union to assist the population and to help stabilise the country, which could have consequences for the wider region.\n(3) In order to bridge the financing gap which will occur, it is appropriate to use funds decommitted from the ninth and previous EDFs.\n(4) The funds should be used to address the needs of the most vulnerable populations in Sudan, in particular in the conflict-affected areas, including Darfur, South Sudan, East Sudan and the Transitional Areas. They will be allocated on the basis of a financing decision to be adopted by the Commission. Provision should also be made to cover the cost of support measures.\n(5) These funds should be managed through centralised and joint management and, for the purpose of simplification, according to the implementation arrangements for the 10th EDF,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An amount of EUR\u00a0150 million from the funds decommitted from projects under the ninth and previous EDFs shall be allocated for the purpose of addressing the needs of the most vulnerable population in Sudan; 2\u00a0% of this amount shall be allocated for support expenditure by the Commission.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These funds shall be managed through centralised and joint management in accordance with the rules and procedures applicable for the 10th EDF.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 July 2010.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nS.
