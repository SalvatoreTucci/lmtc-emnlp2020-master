Areas A and B in Poland can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(9) Decision 2006/415/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.
