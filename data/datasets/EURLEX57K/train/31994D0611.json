When the end-use condition of a construction product is such that it contributes to the generation and spread of fire and smoke within the room of origin (or in a given area), the product will be classified on the base of its  reaction-to-fire performances having regard to the classification system listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the Annex.\n2. Products will be considered in their end-use conditions.\n3.
