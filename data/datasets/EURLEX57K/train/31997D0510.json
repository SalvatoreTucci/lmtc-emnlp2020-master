whereas at the latest since the publication on 26 March 1997 of the draft legislation which is the subject of the present request for a derogation, suppliers, lessors and lessees of property have no longer had a legitimate expectation of the continuation of the Irish legislation in force before that date; whereas it is therefore appropriate to authorize the derogation to take effect from 26 March 1997;\nWhereas the Commission adopted on 10 July 1996 a work programme based on a step-by-step approach for progressing towards a new common system of VAT;\nWhereas the tax treatment of immovable goods is an important issue to be reviewed in this programme;\nWhereas the last package of proposals is to be put forward by mid-1999 and, in order to permit an evaluation of the coherence of the derogation with the global approach of the new common VAT system, the authorization is granted until 31 December 1999;\nWhereas the derogation does not have a negative impact on the own resources of the European Communities accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 21 (1) (a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, Ireland is hereby authorized, from 26 March 1997 until 31 December 1999, to designate the person to whom the supply is made as the person liable to pay the tax where the two following conditions are met:\n- a surrender or assignment of a leasehold interest is treated as a supply of goods made by a lessee,\n- the person acquiring the leasehold interest is a taxable person or a non-taxable legal person.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 July 1997.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
