Where a producer does not make an application for premiums under Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 in respect of the 1996 calendar year or where the premiums to which he is entitled are insufficient to make the set-off referred to in paragraph 1, he shall be required to repay the additional payments made under Article 1 to which he was not entitled.\n3.
