This Regulation lays down the procedure for determining the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of feedingstuffs which may be placed on the market following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which is likely to lead to or has led to significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.\n2.

The Commission shall when submitting the proposal for a Regulation referred to in paragraph 1 take into account the basic standards laid down in accordance with Articles 30 to 31 of the Treaty including the principle that all exposures shall be kept as low as reasonably achievable, taking the aspect of the protection of the health of the general public and economic and social factors into account.\n3. The Council shall, acting by a qualified majority, take a decision on the proposal for a Regulation referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 within the time limit set out in Article 2 (2).\n4. In the event that the Council does not decide within this time limit, the levels set out in the Annex shall continue to apply until the Council does decide or until the Commission withdraws its proposal because the conditions set out in Article 2 (1) no longer apply.", "The period of validity of any Regulation within the meaning of Article 3 shall be limited.
