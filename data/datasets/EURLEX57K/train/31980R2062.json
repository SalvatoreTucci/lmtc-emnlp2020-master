The grounds for withdrawal shall be communicated to the producers' organization or association in advance in writing.\n4. If recognition is withdrawn on the grounds that the producers' organization or association has applied for or made use of recognition fraudulently, aid granted under Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 shall be claimed back.\n5. The grounds for withdrawing recognition shall in each case be communicated to the Commission within two months.\n6.
