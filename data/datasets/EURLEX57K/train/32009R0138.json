This abolition will come into effect as from 1 April 2009.\n(5) For a period of one month (1 March-31 March 2009) Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 would apply for private storage aid granted to certain Italian cheeses. This regulation does not contain all necessary detailed rules for this purpose. A new regulation for granting private storage aid for these Italian cheeses would then have to be adopted in accordance with Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. This new regulation would be applicable for only one month.\n(6) In order to preserve the effectiveness of the scheme and to reduce the administrative burden on operators and national administrations it is considered more appropriate to extend the application of Regulation (EC) No 2659/94 for the contracts concluded under that Regulation before 1 April 2009.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural markets,", "main_body": ["The second sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0826/2008 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018However, it shall continue to apply in respect of contracts concluded under that repealed Regulation before 1 April 2009.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 February 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 284, 1.11.1994, p. 26.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 223, 21.8.2008, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 31.1.2009, p. 1."}
