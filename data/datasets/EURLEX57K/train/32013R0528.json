Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 entered into force on 24 June 2008, but is to be applicable, in accordance with Article 188(2) thereof, only once its implementing provisions are applicable, and on 24 June 2013 at the latest.\n(2) On 20 February 2012, the Commission submitted to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for a Regulation laying down the Union Customs Code, in the form of a recast of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008, in order to replace it before its final date of application of 24 June 2013. However, the ordinary legislative procedure cannot be completed in time for the adoption and entry into force of that proposed Regulation before that date. In the absence of any corrective legislative action, Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 would therefore apply on 24 June 2013 and Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 would be repealed. That would generate legal uncertainty about the customs legislation actually applicable as from that date, and would be an obstacle to maintaining a comprehensive and consistent Union legal framework for customs matters pending the adoption of the proposed Regulation.\n(3) In order to prevent such serious difficulties relating to the customs legislation of the Union and to provide the European Parliament and the Council with adequate time to complete the process of adoption of the recast of the Union Customs Code, the final date of application of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008, as laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 188(2) thereof, should be postponed. The new date of application considered appropriate for that purpose is 1 November 2013.\n(4) In view of the urgency of the matter, an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, should apply.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In the second subparagraph of Article 188(2) of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008, the date of \u202724 June 2013\u2027 is replaced by that of \u20271 November 2013\u2027.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 12 June 2013.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
