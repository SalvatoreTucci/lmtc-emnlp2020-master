The latter may be increased at EUR\u00a0600 where fully justified and subject to availability of budget for questions which are particularly demanding in terms of workload.\n(3) That Annex also states that the Commission will regularly assess the need to adapt these indemnities in light of prices indexes, the evaluation of indemnities paid to experts in other European bodies and the experience on the workload for members, associated members, other scientific advisors and external experts. The first assessment should take place in 2009.\n(4) The current level of indemnities was fixed in 1997 for the members and experts of the predecessors of the Scientific Committees in question and has not been re-evaluated since then. The daily indemnity adapted taking into account the consumer prices increase in the period 1997-2008 based on the Consumer Price Index Data of Eurostat would be of EUR\u00a0381,50 This amount should be rounded up to EUR\u00a0385.\n(5) The distinction between full day and half day meetings should be eliminated in order to take into account travelling and transport time.\n(6) In light of experience, the workload for Rapporteurs depends substantially on the complexity and duration of the activities needed to complete the opinion, taking into account the complexity of the issue, the availability and accessibility of data, the amount of literature to be examined, the need for collaboration with other bodies and the extent and complexity of stakeholder and public consultations required. The current two levels for the Rapporteur indemnity do not reflect the actual range of situations and therefore a wider modulation of the Rapporteur indemnity should be introduced,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Decision 2008/721/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 July 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0241, 10.9.2008, p.\u00a021.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX III\nINDEMNITIES\nMembers of the Scientific Committees, scientific advisors from the Pool and the external experts shall be entitled to indemnities related to their participation in the activities of the scientific committees as follows:\nFor participating in meetings of the Committees, workshops, working groups and other meetings and events organised by the Commission:\n\u2014 EUR\u00a0385 for each of the days during which the attended meeting has taken place,\nFor acting as Rapporteur:\n\u2014 The indemnity is modulated, depending on the workload related to the complexity of the matter, the length of the period needed to complete the opinion, the amount and accessibility of data and scientific literature and information to be collected and processed and the extent and complexity of public and stakeholder consultations and contacts with other bodies, in light of the following indicative criteria:\nAmount Indicative Criteria\n\u2014 Simple and routine issue\n\u2014 Opinion based on examination of a dossier, with limited data search and limited literature examination\n\u2014 No public consultation\n\u2014 No more than 5 months between first and last meeting\n\u2014 Complex issue\n\u2014 Opinion based on significant data and literature search and examination\n\u2014 Stakeholder and/or public consultation with limited feedback examination workload\n\u2014 From 5 to 9 months between the first and the last meeting\n\u2014 Very complex issue\n\u2014 Need for very extensive data and literature search and analysis\n\u2014 Extensive and complex consultations with stakeholder, the public and other scientific bodies, with important feedback to be examined\n\u2014 More than 9 months between the first and the last meeting\n\u2014 In each specific case, on the basis of the criteria mentioned above, the Commission shall indicate in the request for an opinion which of the amounts for the indemnity of the Rapporteur applies.
