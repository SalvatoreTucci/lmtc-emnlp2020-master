However, Article 230(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01308/2013 provides that, as regards the system of milk production limitation, Section III of Chapter III of Title\u00a0I of Part II of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as well as Article 55, Article 85 thereof and Annexes IX and X thereto continue to apply until 31 March 2015.\n(2) In a context of low prices for milk and financial difficulties in the milk sector, it is appropriate to ease the financial burden for producers who have to pay a surplus levy related to the milk quota year 2014/2015 as referred to in Article 15(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 595/2004\u00a0(3). It is therefore appropriate to enable Member States to decide, taking account of varying national circumstances, to collect the amount due according to an instalment scheme. Instalment schemes applied free of interest would however constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty unless the deferred instalments comply with the conditions laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013\u00a0(4).\n(3) Where instalment schemes are applied, the deadlines for controls and notifications should be adapted accordingly in order to ensure that the final controls and notifications cover the deferred payments. Member States should be requested to provide information on the number of beneficiaries under the instalment scheme and the amount not recovered from them each year of the instalment scheme. By 30 November 2015, this information should be available in column (d) of the table in Part 2 of the report set out in Annex IIa to Regulation (EC) No 595/2004. By 30 November 2016 and 30 November 2017, this information should be inserted in column (i) of that table, with the comment \u2018instalment scheme\u2019.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 15, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Article 19(3), the following subparagraph is inserted after the second subparagraph:\n(3) in Article 27, the following paragraph 7 is added:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No\u00a01037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 (OJ L\u00a0347, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a0671).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 of 30 March 2004 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01788/2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector (OJ L\u00a094, 31.3.2004, p.\u00a022).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 of 18 December 2013 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to de minimis aid in the agriculture sector (OJ L\u00a0352, 24.12.2013, p.\u00a09)."}
