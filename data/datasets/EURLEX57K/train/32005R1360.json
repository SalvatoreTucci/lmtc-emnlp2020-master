Some of the agri-environmental commitments, given for a five-year period, expire before 31 December 2006. With the introduction of the principle of cross-compliance provided for in Chapter 1 of Title II of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy\u00a0(2), the obligations which apply to farmers in the absence of agri-environmental commitments are different. New rules will apply to the agri-environmental measure for the next rural development programming period 2007 to 2013.\n(2) Instead of signing new five-year-contracts under rules applicable to the current programming period, Member States may wish to extend agri-environment contracts with farmers currently in force so that the last year of the commitment does not start later than 31 December 2006.\n(3) Greater flexibility should be provided in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004\u00a0(3) in cases where farmers have transferred significant parts of the area for which the initial agri-environment commitment was given, while ensuring that the environmental benefits of the commitment are continued.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 817/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly. The amendments should apply as from 1 January 2005, when some of the initial contracts might have expired.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 817/2004 is amended as follows:\n1) In Article 21, the following paragraph is added:\n2) The first and second paragraphs of Article 36 are replaced by the following:\n(a) if a beneficiary who has already honoured a significant part of the commitment concerned definitively ceases agricultural activities and it is not feasible for a successor to take over the commitment;\n(b) if the transfer of a part of the holding of a beneficiary occurs during a period of extension of the commitment in accordance with Article 21(3) and if the transfer does not exceed 50\u00a0% of the area covered by the commitment before the extension.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2005.
