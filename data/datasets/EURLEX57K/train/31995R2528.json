Article 5 (2) is replaced by the following:\n'2.  For the products referred to in Article 1 (1) (d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, the sucrose  content, including other sugars expressed as sucrose, shall be determined by the application of the  Lane and Eynon method (copper reduction method) to the solution inverted according to  Clerget-Herzfeld. The total sugar content thus determined shall be expressed as sucrose by  multiplying by 0,95.\nNotwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, the sucrose content, including other sugars expressed  as sucrose, of products containing less than 85  % sucrose or other sugars expressed as sucrose,  and invert sugar expressed as sucrose shall be determined by ascertaining the dry matter content.  The dry matter content shall be determined according to the specific gravity of the solution  diluted in a proportion of 1 to 1 by weight and, for solid products, by drying. The dry matter  content shall be expressed as sucrose by multiplying by the coefficient 1.` 2.  In Article 5, the following paragraphs 3 and 4 are added:\n'3.  For the products referred to in Article 1 (1) (f) and (g) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, the  dry matter content shall be determined in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 2.\n4.  For the products referred to in Article 1 (1) (h) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, conversion  into sucrose equivalent shall be by multiplying the dry matter determined in accordance with the  second subparagraph of paragraph 2 by the coefficient 1,9.`", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 October 1995.\nFor the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission"}
