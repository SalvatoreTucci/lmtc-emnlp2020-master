It is therefore appropriate to replace that Directive with a new instrument which extends its scope and\u00a0improves its efficiency.\n(4) Consequently, Directive\u00a080/1119/EEC should be repealed.\n(5) Community statistics on all modes of transport should be collected according to\u00a0common concepts and standards, with the aim of achieving the fullest practicable comparability between transport modes.\n(6) Inland waterways transport does not occur in all Member States and, therefore, the effect of this Regulation is limited to those Member States where this mode of transport exists.\n(7) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and\u00a0can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(8) Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a0322/97 of 17\u00a0February\u00a01997 on Community Statistics\u00a0(3) provides a reference framework for the provisions laid down by this Regulation.\n(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision\u00a01999/468/EC of 28\u00a0June\u00a01999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(4).\n(10) The Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision\u00a089/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(5) has been consulted in accordance with Article\u00a03 of that Decision,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation establishes common rules for the production of Community statistics concerning inland waterways transport.", "Scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall transmit to the Commission (Eurostat) data relating to\u00a0inland waterways transport on their national territory.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds 1\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes shall supply the data referred to\u00a0in Article\u00a04(1).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph\u00a02, Member States where there is no\u00a0international or transit inland waterways transport but where the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds 1\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes shall supply only the data required under Article\u00a04(2).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall not apply to:\n(a) the carriage of goods by vessels of less than 50\u00a0deadweight tonnes;\n(b) vessels used principally for the carriage of passengers;\n(c) vessels used for ferrying purposes;\n(d) vessels used solely for non-commercial purposes by port administrations and public authorities;\n(e) vessels used solely for bunkering or storage;\n(f) vessels not used for the carriage of goods such as fishery vessels, dredgers, floating workshops, houseboats and pleasure craft.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018navigable inland waterway\u2019 means a stretch of water, not part of the sea, over which vessels of a carrying capacity of not less than 50\u00a0tonnes can navigate when normally loaded.
