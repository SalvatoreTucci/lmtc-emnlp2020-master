The sources that were considered were the following: (a) E160d Lycopene obtained by solvent extraction of the natural strains of red tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) with subsequent removal of the solvent, (b) synthetic lycopene and (c) lycopene from Blakeslea trispora.\n(5) Current legislation lays down specifications only for lycopene of red tomatoes and needs to be modified respectively by including the other two sources. Specifications of lycopene extracted from red tomatoes need also to be updated. Dichloromethane does not need to be listed in the list of the extraction solvents, as it is not used any more for lycopene of red tomatoes, according to the information received from stakeholders. Maximum limit for lead needs to be lowered due to safety reasons, and the reference on heavy metals is too generic and not relevant any more. In addition the reference on natural strains needs to be updated according to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6).\n(6) Dichloromethane (methylene chloride) is being reported to be used for manufacturing ready-to-sale formulations of lycopene, mentioned also in the Authority's opinion on Safety of \u2018Lycopene Cold Water Dispersible Products from Blakeslea trispora\u2019 of 4 December 2008\u00a0(7). Similar products are produced also from synthetic lycopene, as mentioned in the Authority's opinion on safety of Synthetic Lycopene of 10 April 2008\u00a0(8). As the Authority evaluated this specific use, it is necessary to authorise this use by the same residual levels that were considered during the evaluation.\n(7) It is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for additives as set out in the Codex Alimentarius drafted by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). In particular, the specific purity criteria need to be adapted to reflect the limits for individual heavy metals of interest, where appropriate.\n(8) Directive 2008/128/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["The Annex I to Directive 2008/128/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 September 2011 at the latest.
