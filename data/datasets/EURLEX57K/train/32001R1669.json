The use of a statistical threshold must therefore be compensated for by an estimate of the data below the threshold.\n(3) The amount of the statistical threshold was calculated in such a way as to meet fully the objective of savings in the collection costs, while taking account of price trends and respecting the relevance and accuracy of the statistics published in accordance with the Combined Nomenclature.\n(4) Other procedures may enable the burden of data collection to be simplified and limited without any effect on quality, for example by using electronic declarations. Application of the statistical threshold must therefore remain optional.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on External Trade Statistics,", "main_body": ["Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1917/2000(3) shall be replaced by the following: \"Article 3\n1.

Application by the Member States of the threshold referred to in paragraph 1 shall remain optional.\n3. The data transmitted periodically by the Member States applying a statistical threshold shall be adjusted so that the value of trade situated below the threshold is included in the external trade statistics, at least for total products.\nIn the absence of harmonised provisions adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 21 of the Basic Regulation, each Member State shall use the method of adjustment it considers most appropriate.\n4.
