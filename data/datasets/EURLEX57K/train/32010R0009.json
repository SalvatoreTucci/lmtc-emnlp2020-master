That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC PTA 5588) as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, laying hens, ducks and turkeys for fattening, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinions of 12 and 19 September 2007\u00a0(2), of 22 November 2007\u00a0(3) and of 2 July 2009\u00a0(4) that the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC PTA 5588) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that the use of that preparation improves the performance of the animals. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 December 2009.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2007) 548, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2007) 586, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 1183, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
