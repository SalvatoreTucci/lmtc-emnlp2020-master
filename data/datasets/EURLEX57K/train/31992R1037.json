Measures shall be carried out within one year of the signing of contracts as referred to in Article 5 (1).\n4. The time limit fixed in paragraph 3 shall not prevent:\n(a) subsequent agreement to an extension of that limit where the party to a contract makes an appropriate application to the competent authority before its expiry date and provides evidence that, owing to exceptional circumstances beyond his control, he  is unable to meet the deadline originally stipulated. However, this extension may not exceed six months;\n(b) measures as referred to in paragraph 2 implemented with effect from the entry into force of this Regulation from qualifying for Community financing.", "1.

The payment of each instalment shall be conditional upon the lodging with the competent authority of a security equal to the amount of the instalment, plus 10 %.\n3. Securities shall be released and the balance shall be paid subject to:\n(a) the forwarding to the Commission and to the competent authority of the report referred to in Article 8 (1) and to verification of the details contained in that report;\n(b) confirmation by the competent authority that the party concerned has fulfilled his obligations as laid down in the contract; and\n(c) confirmation by the competent authority that the party concerned or any third party named in the contract has spent his own contribution for the purposes laid down.\nHowever, at the reasoned request of the party concerned, the balance may be paid after the measure has been executed and the report referred to in Article 8 has been forwarded, provided that securities have been lodged which cover the total amount of  the Community contribution plus 10 %.\n4.
