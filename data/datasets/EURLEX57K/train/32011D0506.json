It is therefore necessary to update the formula of the methods after nearly 6 years of use since their approval and to obtain and use new, up-to-date grading methods with a view to increasing competition as well as to introduce cheaper grading methods.\n(3) Poland has requested the Commission to authorise the replacement of the formula used in the \u2018CAPTEUR GRAS/MAIGRE \u2014 SYDEL (CGM)\u2019, \u2018ULTRA FOM 300\u2019, \u2018FULLY AUTOMATIC ULTRASONIC CARCASE GRADING (AUTOFOM)\u2019 and \u2018IM-03\u2019, methods of grading pig carcasses as well as to authorise four new methods for grading pig carcasses on its territory and has presented a detailed description of the dissection trial, indicating the principles on which that method is based, the results of its dissection trial and the equations used for assessing the percentage of lean meat in the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcasses and the reporting of prices thereof\u00a0(3).\n(4) Examination of that request has revealed that the conditions for authorising those grading methods are fulfilled. Those grading methods should therefore be authorised in Poland.\n(5) Decision 2005/240/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Modifications of the apparatus or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/240/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(a) the \u201cCapteur Gras/Maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM)\u201d apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of the Annex;\n(b) the \u201cUltra FOM 300\u201d apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 2 of the Annex;\n(c) the \u201cFully automatic ultrasonic carcass grading (Autofom)\u201d apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 3 of the Annex;\n(d) the \u201cIM-03\u201d apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 4 of the Annex;\n(e) the \u201cAutofom III\u201d apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 5 of the Annex;\n(f) the \u201cCSB Image-Meater (CSB)\u201d apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 6 of the Annex;\n(g) the \u201cFat-O-Meater II (FOM II)\u201d apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 7 of the Annex;\n(h) the \u201cmanual method (ZP)\u201d and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 8 of the Annex.\n(2) the Annex is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 12 December 2011.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Poland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 August 2011.\nFor the Commission\nDacian CIOLO\u015e\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 74, 19.3.2005, p. 62.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 337, 16.12.2008, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\u2019;\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nMETHODS FOR GRADING PIG CARCASSES IN POLAND\nPart 1\nCAPTEUR GRAS/MAIGRE \u2014 SYDEL (CGM)\n1.
