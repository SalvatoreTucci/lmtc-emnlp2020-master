In its opinion of 13 October 2009\u00a0(4), it stated that, on the basis of the data submitted, the use of that mixture as a preservative in cosmetic products, at a concentration up to 0,2 % (corresponding to a silver concentration of 0,0024 %), does not pose a risk to the health of the consumer. The Committee specified that the substance was safe when used at the same maximum concentration in deodorants and anti-perspirants, as a preservative and/or an active ingredient. Its use in oral and eye products was, however, explicitly excluded given that only dermal exposure was assessed.\n(8) A new entry in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 should be added to reflect the above-mentioned considerations and to adapt it to technical and scientific progress.\n(9) The SCCS assessed tris-biphenyl triazine, which is a UV-filter and a nanomaterial. In its opinion of 20 September 2011\u00a0(5), it concluded that dermal exposure to formulations containing tris-biphenyl triazine with a mean particle size (median primary particle size) of 81 nm results in low absorption of that substance. Also after oral exposure, absorption of tris-biphenyl triazine is low. No systemic effects are observed after oral or dermal exposure up to 500 mg/kg bw/day. The data analysed by the SCCS leads to the conclusion that the use of 10 % tris-biphenyl triazine, including as nanomaterial, as a UV-filter in cosmetic products can be considered safe for dermal application.\n(10) However, the SCCS clarified that, at the time of the risk assessment, there was too much uncertainty to conclude about safe use of 10 % tris-biphenyl triazine in spray applications, because of concerns over possible inhalation exposure. Therefore, the SCCS concluded that spray products containing tris-biphenyl triazine cannot be recommended until additional information on safety after repeated inhalation is provided.\n(11) In light of the SCCS opinion and taking into account that the use of nanomaterials can improve the efficiency of UV-filters, Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 should be amended for the purpose of adapting it to technical and scientific progress.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body":
