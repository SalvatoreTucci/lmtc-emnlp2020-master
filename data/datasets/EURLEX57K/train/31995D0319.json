safety, hygiene and health at work envisages the formalization of regular meetings of this Group;\nWhereas the Council conclusions of 21 December 1992 on the effective implementation and enforcement of Community legislation in the area of social affairs\u00a0(2) invite the Member States and the Commission to encourage and support continued close cooperation between members of the Group, with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity;\nWhereas the Commission communication\u00a0(3) on its programme concerning safety, hygiene and health at work provides for the formalization of the \u2018Group of Senior Labour Inspectors\u2019 as a Committee;\nWhereas the Council resolution of 16 June 1994 on the development of administrative cooperation on the implementation and enforcement of Community legislation in the internal market\u00a0(4) develops an approach to administrative cooperation between the Member States and between these and the Commission, based on obligations of mutual assistance and transparency and on the principles of proportionality and confidentiality;\nWhereas this approach should also be adopted in implementing and enforcing Community social legislation in the field of health and safety at work in particular as stated in the Commission's White Paper on European social policy (\u00a7 10B) and the medium Term Social Action Programme;\nWhereas the identification, analysis and resolution of practical problems related to implementing, and monitoring the enforcement of, secondary Community legislation on health and safety at work fall mainly within the competence of national labour inspection services and require close cooperation between those services and the Commission;\nWhereas the \u2018Committee of Senior Labour Inspectors\u2019, by virtue of its long experience, constitutes an appropriate framework for monitoring, on the basis of close cooperation between its members and the Commission, the effective and equivalent enforcement of secondary Community law on health and safety at work, and for the rigorous analysis of the practical questions involved in monitoring the enforcement of legislation in this field;\nWhereas this Decision does
