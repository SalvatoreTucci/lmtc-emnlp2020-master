The measure therefore has regional and cohesion policy objectives.\n(4) The reduced level of taxation on electricity for consumption in the north of Sweden, which rate set out in Directive 2003/96/EC. Furthermore, the tax reduction is proportionate to the extra heating costs borne by households and service sector companies in northern Sweden. Consequently, that level of taxation should ensure that the incentive effect of taxation to increase energy efficiency is maintained.\n(5) The reduction applied for has been reviewed by the Commission and has been found not to distort competition or hinder the operation of the internal market and it is not considered incompatible with Community policy on the environment, energy and transport.\n(6) That approach is in line with the position taken by the Commission in the State aid Case C 42/03\u00a0(2), where no objections were raised to the State aid element of the tax reduction for a period ending on 31 December 2005.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to authorise Sweden to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity for consumption in the north of Sweden until 31 December 2005,", "main_body": ["Sweden is hereby authorised to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity consumed by households and service sector companies situated in the municipalities listed in the Annex.\nThe reduction shall be proportionate to the extra heating costs due to the northern location, in comparison with the rest of Sweden.\nThe reduced rate shall comply with the requirements of Directive 2003/96/EC, and in particular the minimum rates laid down in Article 10 of that Directive.", "This Decision shall expire on 31 December 2005.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Sweden."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 March 2005.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
