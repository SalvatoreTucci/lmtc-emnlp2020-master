Enforcing collection of the tax in this sector is especially difficult because of the complications of identifying and supervising the activities of non-compliant traders. Hence these arrangements constitute an effective fraud-prevention measure.\n(7) On 7 June 2000 the Commission published a strategy to improve the operation of the VAT system in the short term, in which it undertook to rationalise the large number of derogations currently in force. In some cases, however, this rationalisation could involve extending certain particularly effective derogations to all Member States. The Commission's communication of 20 October 2003 reiterates this compromise.\n(8) It therefore seems advisable to grant the Hellenic Republic an extension for the current derogation until the date of entry into force of a special scheme for the application of VAT to the recycled waste sector, but not later than 31 December 2005.\n(9) The derogation has no adverse impact on the Communities' own resources accruing from VAT, nor does it have an effect on the amount of VAT charged at the final stage.\n(10) In order to ensure the continuous application of Decision 2002/736/EC, provision should be made for this Decision to apply retroactively,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Decision 2002/736/EC, the date \"31 December 2003\" shall be replaced by the following wording: \"until the date of entry into force of a special scheme for the application of VAT to the recycled waste sector amending Directive 77/388/EEC, but not later than 31 December 2005\".", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 February 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nN.
