This Directive applies to extraction solvents used or intended for use in the production of foodstuffs or food ingredients.\nThis Directive shall not apply to extraction solvents used in the production of food additives, vitamins and other nutritional additives, unless such food additives, vitamins or nutritional additives are listed in the Annex.\nHowever, the Member States shall ensure that the use of food additives, vitamins and other nutritional additives does not result in foodstuffs containing extraction solvent residue levels dangerous to human health.\n2. This Directive does not affect the laws of the Member States relating to the use of methanol, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol and tricholoroethylene as extraction solvents in the production of foodstuffs or food ingredients.\n3. For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a) 'solvent' means any substance for dissolving a foodstuff or any component thereof, including any contaminant present in or on that foodstuff;\n(b) 'extraction solvent' means a solvent which is used in an extraction procedure during the processing of raw materials, of foodstuffs, or of components or ingredients of these products and which is removed but which may result in the unintentional, but technically unavoidable, presence of residues or derivatives in the foodstuff or food ingredient.", "1.

Water, to which substances regulating acidity or alkalinity may have been added, other food substances which possess solvent properties and ethanol are authorized as extraction solvent the manufacture of foodstuffs or food ingredients.\n5. Within two years of the adoption of this Directive, the Commission shall, after consulting the Scientific Committee for Food, re-examine the provisions relating to Part I of the Annex hereto and to the following substances and shall propose any necessary amendments acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 100a of the Treaty:\nButan-1-ol\nButan-2-ol\nMethyl-propan-1-ol\nMethyl-propan-2-ol\nMethyl acetate\nCyclohexane\nDichloromethane\nHexane\nEthylmethylketone\nIsobutane\nDiethyl ether\nAs part of this amendment, the Council shall decide whether the residues of the extraction solvents listed in Part III of the Annex should refer to flavourings rather than foodstuffs.\n6.
