Therefore this region of Brazil which is authorised to export fresh poultry meat to the Community is no longer free of Newcastle disease.\n(4) An inspection carried out by the Commission's services in Brazil in October 2000 to assess the animal health situation and the additional information received from the Brazilian authorities have shown that their disease control measures for outbreaks of Newcastle disease are equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 92/66/EEC of 14 July 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle disease(5), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.\n(5) It is appropriate on this basis to continue to allow the importation of fresh poultry meat from this region. Health attestation model A should therefore be amended.\n(6) It is appropriate to restrict the scope of this Decision to poultry species covered by Council Directive 71/118/EEC of 15 February 1971 on health problems affecting trade in fresh poultry meat(6), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(7), and, if necessary, to lay down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for other poultry species in a separate Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex II part 2 model A to Decision 94/984/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply to fresh poultry meat certified as from 1 September 2001.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 August 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 35.\n(2) OJ L 300, 23.11.1999, p. 17.\n(3) OJ L 378, 21.12.1994, p. 11.\n(4) OJ L 210, 3.8.2001, p. 37.\n(5) OJ L 260, 5.9.1992, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 55, 8.3.1971, p. 1.\n(7) OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 31.\nANNEX\n\"\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001232EN.002102.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001232EN.002201.TIF\">\""}
