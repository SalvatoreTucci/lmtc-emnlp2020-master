Nature of the programme\nThe implementation of Community environment policy requires information on the state of the environment, on its vulnerability, and on the pressures and risks resulting from human activities. It also requires information on the interactions between the  environment and socio-economic activities and on the policies concerned. The present programme contributes to the process of building up this information and of making it available, as a harmonized complement to the work programme of the European  Environment Agency. The approach is to develop an environmental component in all relevant parts of Community statistics and to reinforce it where it exists already.\nThe programme will result in an adequate description of those aspects of human activities which affect the environment:\n- either negatively by the pressure exerted on the environment and on natural resources,\n- or positively by the technical, economical or behavioural measures taken by society which reduce these pressures and their effects and improve the condition of the environment.\nThe programme also forms a Community contribution to the environmental statistical programmes of international organizations (OECD, Conference of European Statisticians, Statistical Commission of the United Nations) as well as to the Community response  to Agenda 21.\n2. Work areas\nCommunity statistics will be turned to use and developed particularly in the following areas, so that they provide statistical data required for the production of environmental information:\n- extraction and consumption of raw materials,\n- production and consumption of agricultural and industrial products,\n- energy production and consumption,\n- construction and settlement,\n- leisure and tourism,\n- transport,\n- population growth, households and social welfare,\n- public services.\nThe statistical data to be obtained on features of these areas relevant to the environment can concern such issues as:\n- production processes including techniques for preventing and reducing emissions and pollution,\n- output and handling of waste,\n- use of natural resources,\n- public and private expenditures.\nA further and priority work area is the development of frameworks for integrating economic and environmental data. In particular, the programme will work on:\n- defining an accounting framework for integrating economic data on the environment in overall accounting systems such as environmental satellite accounts and their links with the system of National Accounts and with natural resource accounting,\n- contributing to the development of natural resource accounting.\nDetails of the data which can give environmental information in the above areas will be settled following the methods set out in point 3.\n3. Methods\nEstablishing the contents, definitions, classifications and data collection methodology for the topics indicated above and setting up data collection systems requires:\n(i) studies to identify and define variables and indicators which are environmentally relevant;\n(ii) studies on the availability of data;\n(iii) pilot projects to test: (a) definitions and data collection methodology, (b) special surveys on variables of environmental interest as defined in Article 2 (3), and (c) how integration in general purpose surveys can be achieved;\n(iv) preparation of definitive texts setting out the content, definitions, classifications and data collection methods.\nCarrying out the programme will involve use of new information technology (e.g. remote sensing for data acquisition, computer networks for data transfer, geographical information systems for handling and working-up data) where they constitute the most  cost-efficient approach.\nANNEX B\nEUROSTAT AND EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY COORDINATION  In the context of the agreement on the statistical programme in the field of the environment by the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency and the Director-General of Eurostat and its  approval by the Management Board of the Agency and the Statistical Programme Committee, this programme and its execution are coordinated with the work programme of the Agency. In particular the annual programme put before the Statistical Programme  Committee will be prepared in conjunction with the preparation of the annual programme of the Agency and, in a matching way, will be put before the Management Board of the Agency for approval. The two annual programmes will prepare and provide  integrated data and information, where necessary, through exchange of data and joint Eurostat-Agency activities."}
