To that end, the division into sub-periods for 2008 of the overall import quota of 63\u00a0000 tonnes of wholly milled and semi-milled rice should be amended by providing for an additional sub-period for the month of February for the quota of rice originating in the USA. Out of that quota, a quantity sufficient to attain the objective referred to above should be transferred from the April and July 2008 sub-periods to the February 2008 sub-period, without disturbing the situation on the Community market or imports from other countries of origin, and within the limit of the total annual quantity of 38\u00a0721 tonnes laid down for this quota.\n(4) Due to the abovementioned disturbances to imports, it was not possible to use certain export licences in 2007. Those licences should therefore not be prevented from being used in 2008.\n(5) A derogation from Regulation (EC) No 327/98 should therefore be introduced for 2008.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For 2008, the quantity of 38\u00a0721 tonnes of wholly milled or semi-milled rice falling within CN code 1006\u00a030, covered by the quota with serial No 09.4127, originating in the United States of America and listed in point (a) of Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 327/98, shall be broken down as laid down in the Annex hereto.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The export licences referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 327/98 issued by the third countries referred to in that Article in 2007 may be used for applications for import licences submitted for the 2008 quota year.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 January 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 20.6.1996, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 96.
