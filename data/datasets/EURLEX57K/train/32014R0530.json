That assessment should consider both long and short net positions calculated in accordance with Article 327(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2), after having given an allowance for hedges provided by credit derivatives in accordance with Articles 346 and 347 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n(3) The first subparagraph of Article 77(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU covering specific risk in the trading book refers to \u2018a large number of material positions in debt instruments of different issuers\u2019.
