Moreover, checks on compliance with this Article involve a disproportionately high amount of effort compared with the purpose of the measure. These restrictive conditions should therefore be abolished in order to simplify the rules.\n(4) New varieties of flax and hemp grown for fibre may be considered eligible. These should therefore be included in the list of varieties of flax and hemp grown for fibre eligible for the support system in Annex XII to Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
