For the sake of clarity and to provide valuable information of animal or public health importance about the causal pathogen agent the different types of equine encephalomyelitis should be explicitly listed in this Annex.\n(3) In addition, the diseases rabies, anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis, enzootic bovine leukosis and ovine and caprine brucellosis have been widely eradicated by most Member States. As a result, outbreaks thereof have become less frequent in large areas of the Union. From now on, outbreaks should be notified to the Commission and to the other Member States. It is therefore necessary to add these diseases to Annex I.\n(4) To avoid administrative burden, under certain circumstances it is appropriate to require weekly notifications of primary outbreaks and monthly notifications of secondary outbreaks of the abovementioned diseases.\n(5) Certain Member States and regions thereof have not yet achieved the officially free status for non-exotic diseases such as bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis, enzootic bovine leukosis or ovine and caprine brucellosis, as regulated by Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine\u00a0(2) and Council Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals\u00a0(3). To avoid a disproportionate quantity of notifications, it should not be required to notify outbreaks of the abovementioned diseases in non-free Member States or regions thereof.\n(6) In the future, notifications to the Commission and to the World Animal Health Information System of the World Organisation for Animal Health (hereinafter \u2018OIE\u2019) concerning animal diseases will be entered in one system (the Animal Disease Information System \u2014 ADIS). It is thus appropriate, where possible, to use in Annex I to Directive 82/894/EEC the same terminology as used by the OIE.\n(7) An online reporting system is already in place for the occurrence of low pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds. It is therefore appropriate to explicitly indicate that as regards avian influenza, highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks should be notifiable in poultry, captive birds and wild birds, while low pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks should only be notifiable in poultry and captive birds.\n(8) Epizootic ulcerative syndrome was removed from the list of exotic diseases set out in Part II of Annex IV to Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals\u00a0(4) by Commission Implementing Directive 2012/31/EU of 25 October 2012 amending Annex IV to Council Directive 2006/88/EC as regards the list of fish species susceptible to Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia and the deletion of the entry for Epizootic ulcerative syndrome\u00a0(5). Consequently, the disease should also be removed from Annex I to Directive 82/894/EEC.\n(9) Annexes I and II to Directive 82/894/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Directive 82/894/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2013.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nMaro\u0161 \u0160EF\u010cOVI\u010c\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 378, 31.12.1982, p. 58.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p. 1977/64.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 46, 19.2.1991, p. 19.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 24.11.2006, p. 14.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 26.10.2012, p. 26.\nANNEX\nAnnexes I and II to Directive 82/894/EEC are amended as follows:\n(1) Annex I is replaced by the following:\nList A.1:\n\u2014 African horse sickness\n\u2014 African swine fever\n\u2014 Anthrax\n\u2014 Avian influenza (HPAI in poultry, captive birds and wild birds and LPAI in poultry and captive birds)\n\u2014 Bluetongue\n\u2014 Bovine spongiform encephalopathy\n\u2014 Classical swine fever\n\u2014 Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia\n\u2014 Dourine\n\u2014 Equine encephalomyelitis of the following types:\n\u2014 Eastern equine encephalomyelitis\n\u2014 Japanese encephalitis\n\u2014 Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis\n\u2014 West Nile fever\n\u2014 Western equine encephalomyelitis\n\u2014 Equine infectious anaemia\n\u2014 Foot-and-mouth disease\n\u2014 Glanders\n\u2014 Lumpy skin disease\n\u2014 Newcastle disease\n\u2014 Peste des petits ruminants\n\u2014 Infection with rabies virus\n\u2014 Rift Valley fever\n\u2014 Rinderpest\n\u2014 Sheep pox and goat pox\n\u2014 Small hive beetle infestation (Aethina tumida)\n\u2014 Swine vesicular disease\n\u2014 Tropilaelaps infestation of honey bees\n\u2014 Vesicular stomatitis\nList A.2:\n\u2014 Bovine brucellosis\n\u2014 Bovine tuberculosis\n\u2014 Enzootic bovine leukosis\n\u2014 Caprine and ovine brucellosis (excluding Brucella ovis)\n\u2014 Epizootic haematopoietic necrosis\n\u2014 Infectious haematopoietic necrosis\n\u2014 Infectious salmon anaemia\n\u2014 Infection with Perkinsus marinus\n\u2014 Infection with Mikrocytos mackini\n\u2014 Infection with Marteilia refringens\n\u2014 Infection with Bonamia ostreae\n\u2014 Infection with Bonamia exitiosa\n\u2014 Koi herpes virus disease\n\u2014 Taura syndrome\n\u2014 Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia\n\u2014 White spot disease\n\u2014 Yellowhead disease\u2019.\n(2) Annex II is amended as follows:\n(a) point C is replaced by the following:\n\u2018C.
