At present such agreements have been concluded by Council Decision 2001/870/EC(3) with the ACP States party to Protocol No 3 on ACP sugar(4) attached to Annex V to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, and with the Republic of India.\n(2) The quantities of special preferential sugar to be imported are calculated in accordance with the said Article 39 on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance. The balance indicates the need to import raw sugar and to open for the 2002/03 marketing year tariff quotas at the special reduced rate of duty as provided for in the above agreements so that the Community refineries' supply needs can be met for part of the year. In view of the forecasts for raw cane sugar production which are now available for the 2002/03 marketing year and as a result of the presumed maximum refining needs fixed by Member State and the shortfall resulting from the forecast supply balance, provision should be made to authorise imports for each refining Member State for the period 1 July 2002 to 28 February 2003.\n(3) The agreements concluded by Decision 2001/870/EC lay down that the refiners in question must pay a minimum purchase price equal to the guaranteed price for raw sugar, minus the adjustment aid fixed for the marketing year in question. This minimum price must therefore be fixed by taking account of the factors applying in the 2002/03 marketing year.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The following quotas are opened for the period 1 July 2002 to 28 February 2003 pursuant to Decision 2001/870/EC in respect of imports of raw cane sugar for refining falling within CN code 1701 11 10:\n(a) a tariff quota of 173200 tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in the ACP States covered by that Decision, bearing the serial number 09.4097, and\n(b) a tariff quota of 10000 tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in India, bearing the serial number 09.4097.", "1.
