After considering all the data on stability, degradation products and toxicology, EFSA concluded that neotame is not of safety concern with respect to the proposed uses as a sweetener and flavour enhancer and established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0\u20132\u00a0mg/kg bw/day. EFSA also noted that conservative estimates of neotame dietary exposure both in adults and children suggest that it is very unlikely that the ADI would be exceeded at the proposed use levels.\n(3) Neotame is a highly intense sweetener with a sweetness potency ranging from 7\u00a0000 to 13\u00a0000 times that of sucrose. It may be used as a replacement for sucrose or other sweeteners in a broad range of products. Neotame can be used alone or with other sweeteners. In addition, neotame can modify the flavour of foods and beverages.\n(4) It is necessary to amend the Annex of Directive 94/35/EC to permit the use of neotame in the same food applications as the other currently permitted intense sweeteners. Neotame should be assigned a new E number, namely E 961. In order to facilitate the marketing and use of this new sweetener, it is provided that products which comply with the provisions of this Directive may be marketed from the date of its entry into force.\n(5) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making\u00a0(4), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Union, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 94/35/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 12\u00a0October 2010 at the latest.
