This virus is one of the multiple forms that can take the disease \u2018influenza\u2019, listed in Annex I to Decision 2000/96/EC. However, given that this new virus poses a risk of a pandemic influenza and requires an immediate coordination between the Community and the national competent authorities, it is necessary to provide for a specific case definition differentiating it from the more general case definition of influenza, that will enable the national competent authorities to communicate relevant information to the Community network pursuant to Article 4 of Decision No 2119/98/EC.\n(4) In accordance with Article 9 of the Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control\u00a0(4) (ECDC), the ECDC provided, at the request of the Commission, a technical document on the case definition for this communicable disease assisting the Commission and Member States in the development of intervention strategies in the field of surveillance and response. The case definitions listed in the Annex to Decision 2002/253/EC should be updated on the basis of this contribution.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 7 of Decision No 2119/98/EC,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2002/253/EC is completed by the additional case definition contained in the Annex to the present Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 April 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 3.10.1998, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a028, 3.2.2000, p.\u00a050.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a086, 3.4.2002, p.\u00a044.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0142, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nThe following wording is inserted in the Annex to Decision 2002/253/EC:\n\u2018NOVEL INFLUENZA VIRUS A(H1N1) (THE SO-CALLED SWINE INFLUENZA VIRUS A(H1N1) AND MEXICAN INFLUENZA VIRUS)\u00a0(1)\nClinical criteria\nAny person with one of the following three:\n\u2014 fever >\u00a038\u00a0\u00b0C AND signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection,\n\u2014 pneumonia (severe respiratory illness),\n\u2014 death from an unexplained acute respiratory illness.\nLaboratory criteria\nAt least one of the following tests:\n\u2014 RT-PCR,\n\u2014 viral culture (requiring BSL 3 facilities),\n\u2014 four-fold rise in novel influenza virus A(H1N1) specific neutralising antibodies (implies the need for paired sera, from acute phase illness and then at convalescent stage 10-14 days later minimum).\nEpidemiological criteria\nAt least one of the following three in the seven days before disease onset:\n\u2014 a person who was a close contact to a confirmed case of novel influenza A(H1N1) virus infection while the case was ill,\n\u2014 a person who has travelled to an area where sustained human-to-human transmission of novel influenza A(H1N1) is documented,\n\u2014 a person working in a laboratory where samples of the novel influenza A(H1N1) virus are tested.\nCase classification\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Case under investigation\nAny person meeting the clinical and epidemiological criteria.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probable case\nAny person meeting the clinical AND epidemiological criteria AND with a laboratory result showing positive influenza A infection of an unsubtypable type.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confirmed case\nAny person meeting the laboratory criteria for confirmation.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The name will be changed in line with the definition provided by the World Health Organisation.\u2019."}
