Those examinations and the collection of samples are to be carried out in accordance with Annex II to Decision 97/794/EC.\n(3) Annex II to Decision 97/794/EC requires that at least 3\u00a0% of the consignments of biungulate animals and equidae are subjected on a monthly basis to serological sampling with a view to checking compliance with the health requirements laid down in the accompanying veterinary certificate.\n(4) Article 2(c) of Council Directive 2009/156/EC\u00a0(3) provides a definition for registered equidae, of which registered horses represent a taxonomic subset in accordance with Article 19 of that Directive. Therefore it may be decided that importation from a third country or part of a third country is to be confined to particular species or categories of equidae or the special conditions for the temporary entry into Union territory of registered equidae or equidae intended for special uses or their re-entry into Union territory after being temporarily exported, shall be established.\n(5) By adopting Commission Decisions 92/260/EEC\u00a0(4) and 93/195/EEC\u00a0(5) on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses and for the re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export, and by limiting, in accordance with Commission Decision 2004/211/EC\u00a0(6), imports into the Union of equidae from certain third countries to registered horses only as specified in Annex I to Commission Decision 93/197/EEC\u00a0(7), the Commission not only defined registered horses as a taxonomic subset of registered equidae defined in Article 2(c) of Directive 2009/156/EC, but also took into account the limited risks arising from the introduction of these animals into the Union.\n(6) In the light of the experience gained, it appears that, in case of registered horses, that 3\u00a0% rate of blood sampling is not justified by the expected benefits to the monitoring of compliance with the health requirements laid down in the accompanying veterinary certificates. Therefore, in the case of registered horses, the fixed rate of sampling for serological testing should be replaced by a risk-based collection of any appropriate sample, where considered necessary by the official veterinarian in the border inspection post.\n(7) Annex II to Decision 97/794/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 97/794/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 February 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 56.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 97/794/EC of 12 November 1997 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/496/EEC as regards veterinary checks on live animals to be imported from third countries (OJ L 323, 26.11.1997, p. 31).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2009/156/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing the movement and importation from third countries of equidae (OJ L 192, 23.7.2010, p. 1.)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 92/260/EEC of 10 April 1992 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses (OJ L 130, 15.5.1992, p. 67).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 93/195/EEC of 2 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for the re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export (OJ L 86, 6.4.1993, p. 1).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2004/211/EC of 6 January 2004 establishing the list of third countries and parts of territory thereof from which Member States authorise imports of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species, and amending Decisions 93/195/EEC and 94/63/EC (OJ L 73, 11.3.2004, p. 1).\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 93/197/EEC of 5 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production (OJ L 86, 6.4.1993, p. 16).\nANNEX\nPart III of Annex II to Decision 97/794/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018III.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling procedure\nSampling with a view to checking compliance with the health requirements laid down in the accompanying veterinary certificate shall be undertaken as follows:\n1.
