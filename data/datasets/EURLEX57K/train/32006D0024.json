There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products.\n(2) On 12 October 2005 Romania notified the Commission of the isolation of the Asian strain of the avian influenza virus collected from a clinical case in poultry. Commission Decision 2005/710/EC of 13 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Romania\u00a0(3) was therefore adopted.\n(3) That Decision was amended to regionalise Romania for imports into the Community of poultry meat and poultry meat products in view of the fact that the outbreaks of the Asian strain of the avian influenza virus in Romania were confined to the Danube delta.\n(4) New outbreaks of the disease have occurred in that part of Romania considered free of infection. The area of Romania from which imports into the Community of poultry meat and poultry meat products should still be prohibited therefore needs to be extended to cover that part of the country east and south of the Carpathian Mountains.\n(5) As Romania has now confirmed the presence of the disease on its territory, the title of Decision 2005/710/EC should be amended to take this into account.\n(6) Decision 2005/710/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/710/EC is amended as follows:\n1. the title is replaced by the following:\n2. the Annex is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "The Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
