All amendments to the CPV codes or their descriptions should be listed in a separate new Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002.\n(9) The entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 204/2002 of 19 December 2001(3) amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93 on the statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) in the European Economic Community has rendered obsolete the information given in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002, which shows the correspondence between the CPV and the CPA 96.\n(10) In Common Position (EC) No 33/2003 of 20 March 2003 adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts(4) and Common Position (EC) No 34/2003 of 20 March 2003 adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and the Council coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors(5), product areas are not established by means of reference to the statistical classification of products by activity (CPA).\n(11) For those reasons, it is not appropriate to update the correspondence table between the CPV and the CPA 96 set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002. That Annex should therefore be deleted.\n(12) Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 is amended as follows:\nAnnex I is replaced by the text set out in Annex I to this Regulation;\nAnnex II is replaced by the text set out in Annex II to this Regulation;\nAnnex III is replaced by the text set out in Annex III to this Regulation;\nAnnex IV is amended in accordance with Annex IV to this Regulation;\nAnnex V is amended in accordance with Annex V to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 2003.\nFor the Commission\nFrederik Bolkestein\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 340, 16.12.2002, p. 1.\n(2) OJ C 192, 12.8.2002, p. 50.\n(3) OJ L 36, 6.2.2002, p. 1.\n(4) OJ C 147 E, 24.6.2003, p. 1.\n(5) OJ C 147 E, 24.6.2003, p. 137.\nANNEX I\nCOMMON PROCUREMENT VOCABULARY (CPV)\nStructure of the classification system\n1. The CPV consists of a main vocabulary and a supplementary vocabulary.\n2. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure comprising codes of up to nine digits associated with a wording that describes the supplies, works or services forming the subject of the contract.\nThe numerical code consists of 8 digits, subdivided as follows:\n- the first two digits identify the divisions (XX000000-Y);\n- the first three digits identify the groups (XXX00000-Y);\n- the first four digits identify the classes (XXXX0000-Y);\n- the first five digits identify the categories (XXXXX000-Y).\nEach of the last three digits gives a greater degree of precision within each category.\nA ninth digit serves to verify the previous digits.\n3. The supplementary vocabulary may be used to expand the description of the subject of a contract. The items are made up of an alphanumeric code with a corresponding wording allowing further details to be added regarding the specific nature or destination of the goods to be purchased.\nThe alphanumeric code is made up of:\n- a first level comprising a letter corresponding to a section;\n- a second level comprising four digits, the first three of which denote a subdivision and the last one being for verification purposes.\nMAIN VOCABULARY\n>TABLE>\nSUPPLEMENTARY VOCABULARY\n>TABLE>\nANNEX II\nAMENDMENTS TO THE CPV CODES OR DESCRIPTIONS OF ANNEX I TO REGULATION (EC) No 2195/2002\nII.A - TABLE OF NEW AND EXISTING CPV CODES ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW DESCRIPTION\n>TABLE>\nII.B - TABLE OF NEW AND REVISED CPV CODES ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXISTING DESCRIPTION\n>TABLE>\nII.C - TABLE OF DELETED CPV CODES OF ANNEX I TO REGULATION (EC) No 2195/2002\n>TABLE>\nII.D - TABLE OF DELETED DESCRIPTIONS OF ANNEX I TO REGULATION (EC) No 2195/2002\n>TABLE>\nANNEX III\nCORRESPONDENCE TABLE BETWEEN CPV AND CPC PROV.\n>TABLE>\nANNEX IV\nAMENDMENTS TO ANNEX IV TO REGULATION (EC) No 2195/2002\nCorrespondence table between CPV and NACE Rev. 1\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\nANNEX V\nAMENDMENTS TO ANNEX V TO REGULATION (EC) No 2195/2002\nCorrespondence table between CPV and CN\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>"}
