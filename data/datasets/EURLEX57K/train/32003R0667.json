However, in that period no price quotations were registered for cows in that Member State and it is therefore appropriate instead to take account of the price evolution for such animals in neighbouring markets.\n(3) Consequently, the purchase price for cows should be reduced by 20 %, and the purchase price for other animals over 30 months, by 8 %. The rate of Community co-financing should be reduced accordingly.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 716/96 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 716/96 is amended as follows:\n1.
