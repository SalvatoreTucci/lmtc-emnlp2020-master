That Directive incorporated UN regulations in the EU type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that Directive, UN regulations have increasingly replaced Union legislation in the framework of the EU type-approval.\n(4) In the light of experience and technical developments, the requirements relating to certain elements or features covered by UN Regulations Nos 3, 7, 13, 19, 23, 37, 38, 41, 43, 45, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 59, 75, 78, 86, 98, 99, 106, 107, 110, 112, 113, 117, 119, 123, 128, 129, by UN GTR No 3 with regard to motorcycle braking, and by UN GTR No 4 with regard to the Worldwide Heavy-Duty Certification procedure, need to be adapted.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to establish the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf in the Administrative Committee of the Revised 1958 Agreement and in the Executive Committee of the Parallel Agreement, as regards the adoption of those UN acts,", "main_body": ["The position to be adopted on behalf of the Union in the Administrative Committee of the Revised 1958 Agreement and in the Executive Committee of the Parallel Agreement on 10 to 13 March 2015 shall be to vote in favour of the UN acts listed in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 March 2015.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
