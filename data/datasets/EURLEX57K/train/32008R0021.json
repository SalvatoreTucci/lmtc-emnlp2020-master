It applies to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin and in certain specific cases to exports thereof.\n(2) Annex X, Chapter C, to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 sets out a list of rapid tests approved for the monitoring of TSEs in bovine, ovine and caprine animals.\n(3) Changes to rapid tests and to test protocols may only be made after prior notification to the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for TSEs and provided that the CRL finds that the changes do not alter the sensitivity, specificity or reliability of the tests. On 13 April 2007, the CRL approved changes made to the currently approved TSE rapid post-mortem test \u2018Enfer TSE Kit version 2.0\u2019, and therefore recommended that the amended version (Enfer TSE version 3) should also be listed in Annex X, Chapter C, to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0999/2001.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 January 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.
