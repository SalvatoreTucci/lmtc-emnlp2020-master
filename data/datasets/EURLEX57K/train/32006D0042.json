By letter dated 31 May 2005, the Commission notified Latvia that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.\n(4) The timber market in Latvia is dominated by small local companies and individual suppliers. The nature of the market and businesses involved have generated tax fraud which the tax authorities have found difficult to control. In order to combat this abuse, a special provision was included in Latvia\u2019s law on VAT, laying down that the person liable to pay tax is, under certain circumstances, the taxable person for whom the taxable supply of goods or services is carried out.\n(5) Article 21(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, in the version set out in Article 28g of the said Directive, stipulates that under the internal system the taxable person supplying goods or services is normally liable for payment of the tax. However, the 2003 Act of Accession, and in particular Chapter 7, point 1(b) of Annex VIII thereto, authorised Latvia for a limited period to continue to apply its procedure for charging VAT on timber transactions.\n(6) The Commission understands that this arrangement has effectively enabled Latvia to reduce the risk of VAT evasion and to simplify the procedure for charging the tax in the timber market.\n(7) The derogation has no adverse impact on the Communities\u2019 own resources accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, in the version set out in Article 28g thereof, Latvia is hereby authorised to continue to designate the recipient as the person liable to pay VAT in the case of timber transactions from 1 May 2005 to 31 December 2009.\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Latvia."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 January 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nK.-H.
