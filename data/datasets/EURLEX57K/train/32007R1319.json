In order to comply with that requirement, organic farmers enlarge their holdings in particular by purchasing or renting pasture and perennial forage parcels.\n(2) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 purchased and rented non-organic land has to pass through a conversion period before becoming organic. Further, feedingstuffs obtained during the first year of conversion are not considered to be in-conversion feedingstuffs, nor can they be sold easily for use in conventional farming, as there is a very limited market for such non-organic perennial forage.\n(3) The use of non-organically produced feedingstuffs for herbivores will be incompatible with Annex I, Part B, point 4.8(a), of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 after 31 December 2007. Any requirement to continue grazing to use land purchased or rented for the holding itself during its first year of conversion to organic farming will become difficult to fulfil after that date.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to allow the inclusion of a certain percentage of feed obtained from first year in-conversion parcels in the feed formula of rations.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["In Part B of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, point 4.4 is replaced by the following:\n\u20184.4. Until 31 December 2008, up to 50\u00a0% of the feed formula of rations on average may comprise in-conversion feedingstuffs. When the in-conversion feedingstuffs come from a unit of the holding itself, this percentage may be increased to 80\u00a0%.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 November 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p. 1.
