This authorisation was based on an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority of 18\u00a0September 2007\u00a0(4). In that opinion that Authority considered that supplementation of diets with that preparation results in a decrease in phosphorus excretion via urine and an increase in its excretion via faeces, linked to a decrease in apparent phosphorus digestibility. It concluded that that preparation can reduce the phosphorus absorption of adult cats.\n(3) Directive 2008/38/EC already includes feed with a low level of phosphorus in the line \u2018support of renal function in case of chronic renal insufficiency\u2019. The same positive effect can be obtained if the absorption of phosphorus contained in the feed is reduced. Lanthanum carbonate octahydrate should therefore be included in the line \u2018Support of renal function in case of chronic renal insufficiency\u2019 in the list of intended uses in Part B of the Annex I to Directive 2008/38/EC.\n(4) Directive 2008/38/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex I to Directive 2008/38/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 20 February 2009 at the latest.
