Regulation (EC) No 530/1999 has been implemented by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1738/2005 of 21 October 2005 amending Regulation (EC) No 1916/2000 as regards the definition and transmission of information on the structure of earnings\u00a0(4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 698/2006 of 5 May 2006 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 530/1999 as regards quality evaluation of structural statistics on labour costs and earnings\u00a0(5).\n(2) The Annexes to those implementing Regulations refer to the International Standard Classification of Occupations, \u2018ISCO-88\u2019 or the European version of this classification hereinafter referred to as \u2018ISCO-88 (COM)\u2019.\n(3) The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has revised the version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations used hitherto (ISCO-88) with the objective of making available a more effective classification, which can be used by countries in the next round of population censuses, as well as in national employment services and other client-oriented applications. In order to ensure comparability between data on occupations from the EU Member States and the rest of the world it is necessary to use this revised classification (ISCO-08) in the main European Statistical System surveys collecting data on occupations before the next round of population census that will take place in 2011.\n(4) The establishment of a revised Standard Classification of Occupations makes it necessary to modify in particular the references to ISCO-88 and to the European version of this classification ISCO-88 (COM). Therefore, Regulations (EC) No 1738/2005, (EC) No 698/2006 and (EC) No 377/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) It is considered advisable that, as much as possible, the first reference year for the data transmission of ISCO-08 data is the same in all statistical domains concerned, in line with the next round of Census, which will have 2011 as reference year. The recommendation is therefore to use 2011 as first year of reference for the transmission of data on occupations according to ISCO-08 with the exception of the Structure of Earnings Survey, conducted every four years, which would apply it in 2010.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee,", "main_body": ["In Regulation (EC) No 1738/2005 the term \u2018ISCO-88 (COM)\u2019 is replaced by \u2018ISCO-08\u2019 throughout the text of Annexes I, II and III.", "In Regulation (EC) No 698/2006 the term \u2018ISCO-88\u2019 is replaced by \u2018ISCO-08\u2019 throughout the text of the Annex.", "In Regulation (EC) No 377/2008 the term \u2018ISCO-88 (COM)\u2019 is replaced by \u2018ISCO-08\u2019 throughout the text of the Annex.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticles 1 and 2 shall apply from 1 January 2010.
