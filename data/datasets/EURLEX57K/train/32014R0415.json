In accordance with Article 3 of that Regulation the agricultural products listed in Annex III thereto are to be admitted for import into the Union within the limits of the tariff quotas as set out in that Annex. The quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 are to be administered by the Commission in accordance with Article\u00a0184(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n(2) Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 includes tariff quotas for milk and milk products. It is necessary to include those quotas in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001\u00a0(3) and to insert in Article 19 of that Regulation a reference to the relevant rule on the proof of origin which is required to import under those quotas.\n(3) Since the quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 are open only until 31 October 2014, the period of lodging import licence applications and the period of validity of import licences should be specified.\n(4) According to Article 10(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, importers approved in May 2013 can import under quotas only during the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014. As the quotas opened for Ukraine are exceptionally running over two consecutive six-months periods, approved importers could only import until 30 June 2014 whilst the concerned quotas are open until 31 October 2014. It is therefore appropriate to enable those importers to import under the quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0374/2014 until 31 October 2014.\n(5) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1001/2013\u00a0(4), has replaced some CN codes in Annex I to\u00a0Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87\u00a0(5) by new CN codes which now differ from those referred to in Regulation\u00a0(EU) No 374/2014. The new CN codes should therefore be reflected in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02535/2001.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Since the quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 are open only until 31 October 2014, this Regulation should enter into force as soon as possible.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 is amended as follows:\n(a) In Article 5, the following point (l) is added:\n\u2018(l) the quotas referred to in Part L of Annex I\u2019\n(b) In Article 19(1), the following point (j) is added:\n\u2018(j) Article 2(a) of Regulation 374/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6).\n(c) In Annex I, a new Part L is added, the text of which is set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Licence applications for the quotas referred to in Part L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 as added by Article 1(c) of this Regulation, shall be submitted no later than 13.00, Brussels time, on the 10th calendar day following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\nLicences issued shall be valid from the day of their issue until 31 October 2014.", "By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, importers approved in 2013 and in 2014 are authorised to import under the quotas referred to in Part L of Annex I to Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 2535/2001 as added by Article 1(c) of this Regulation, until 31 October 2014.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0347, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a0671.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine (OJ L 118, 22.4.2014, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 of 14 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01255/1999 as regards the import arrangements for milk and milk products and opening tariff quotas (OJ L\u00a0341, 22.12.2001, p.\u00a029).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1001/2013 of 4 October 2013 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (OJ\u00a0L\u00a0290, 31.10.2013, p.\u00a01).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (OJ L\u00a0256, 7.9.1987, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\n\u2018I.
