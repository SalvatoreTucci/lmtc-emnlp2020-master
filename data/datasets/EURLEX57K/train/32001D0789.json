It appears therefore appropriate to enlarge the area from which dispatch of certain meats is authorized, and to include in addition to pig meat also meat from other livestock and from farmed and wild game of species susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease.\n(3) Meat from small ruminants, farmed game and wild game should be allowed from counties that had no outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease during this epidemic, and in addition in the case of meat from wild game, the county of origin should not border directly with a county not included in Annex III.\n(4) Certain livestock holdings situated in areas included in the list in Annex III may wish to restock with animals the origin of which is outside the areas listed in Annex I or Annex II. Such animal transport may pose a potential risk in particular for transport means returning empty from Great Britain. Therefore provisions are necessary to ensure official control and certification of the cleansing and disinfection of the means of transport.\n(5) The situation shall be reviewed at the meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee scheduled for 4-5 December 2001 and the measures adapted where necessary.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 2001/740/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
