The Authority communicated its view on plant oils/citronella oil to the notifier. The Commission invited the notifier to submit comments on the draft review report for plant oils/citronella oil. The draft review report and the view of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the draft review report was finalised on 3 October 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for plant oils/citronella oil.\n(3) It is confirmed that the active substance plant oils/citronella oil is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n(4) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is necessary to amend the conditions of approval. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n(5) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Member States should be provided with time to amend or withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing plant oils/citronella oil.\n(7) For plant protection products containing plant oils/citronella oil, where Member States grant any grace period in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest eighteen months after the date of entry into force of the regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nPart A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Transitional measures\nMember States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing plant oils/citronella oil as active substance by 5 December 2014.", "Grace period\nAny grace period granted by Member States in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 shall be as short as possible and shall expire 5 December 2015 at the latest.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 May 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0309, 24.11.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2008/127/EC of 18 December 2008 amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include several active substances (OJ L\u00a0344, 20.12.2008, p.\u00a089).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 of 3 December 2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (OJ L\u00a0379, 24.12.2004, p.\u00a013).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (OJ L\u00a0153, 11.6.2011, p.\u00a01).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance plant oils/citronella oil.
