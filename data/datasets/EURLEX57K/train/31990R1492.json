whereas Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 784/90 provides that the resulting reduction for the prices and amounts fixed in ecus by the Council for the 1990/91 marketing year be specified and that the value of those reduced prices and amounts be fixed; whereas the basic price and buying-in price for peaches, nectarines and lemons for the 1990/91 marketing year were fixed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1194/90 (6);\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1370/89 (7) fixed the intervention thresholds for the 1989/90 marketing year at 376 600 tonnes for peaches, 45 800 tonnes for nectarines and 158 300 tonnes for lemons;\nWhereas Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1122/89 of 27 April 1989 laying down specific measures for the application of certain intervention thresholds in the fruit and vegetables sector for the 1989/90 marketing year (8) lays down that where, during the 1989/90 marketing year, the sum of the quantities of peaches, nectarines or lemons bought in Spain, on the one hand, and in the Community of Ten on the other, pursuant to Articles 15, 15a, 15b, 19 and 19a of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 exceeds the sum of the intervention thresholds fixed for each product for all or part of that marketing year, the basic and buying-in prices fixed for that product for the 1990/91 marketing year are to be reduced in the case of peaches, nectarines and lemons by 1 % for every 22 700 tonnes, 2 900 tonnes and 11 000 tonnes respectively by which the intervention threshold is exceeded;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1370/89, the overrun in the intervention threshold fixed for lemons for the 1989/90 marketing year is to be assessed on the basis of quantities bought in between 1 March 1989 and 28 February 1990;\nWhereas, on the basis of information supplied by the Member States, the intervention measures taken by the Community with the exception of Portugal for the 1989/90 marketing year related to 515 141 tonnes for peaches, 82 473 tonnes for nectarines and 195 564 tonnes for lemons; whereas the Commission therefore noted an overrun in the intervention thresholds fixed for that marketing year of 138 541 tonnes for peaches, 37 264 tonnes for nectarines and 37 925 tonnes for lemons;\nWhereas consequently, the basic and buying-in prices for peaches, nectarines and lemons for the 1990/91 marketing year, as fixed by Regulation (EEC) No 1194/90, must be reduced for peaches by 6 %, for nectarines by 12 % and for lemons by 3 %; whereas these reductions must be added to those resulting from the monetary realignment of 5 January 1990;\nWhereas during the first phase Portugal is authorized to maintain, in the fruit and vegetable sectors, the regulations in force under the former national arrangements for the organization of its agricultural internal market, subject to the conditions provided for in Articles 262 to 265 of the Act of Accession; whereas, therefore, the prices and the amounts fixed by this Regulation are valid only in the Community with the exception of Portugal;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["The basic and buying-in prices for peaches, nectarines and lemons for the 1990/91 marketing year, as fixed by Regulation (EEC) No 1194/90, shall be reduced by 6,16 % for peaches, 12,15 % for nectarines and 3,17 % for lemons and shall be as set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 May 1990.\nFor the Commission\nRay MAC SHARRY\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 118, 20. 5. 1972, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 119, 11. 5. 1990, p. 43.\n(3) OJ No L 164, 24. 6. 1985, p. 6.\n(4) OJ No L 182, 3. 7. 1987, p. 1.\n(5) OJ No L 83, 30. 3. 1990, p. 102.\n(6) OJ No L 119, 11. 5. 1990, p. 46.\n(7) OJ No L 137, 20. 5. 1989, p. 19.\n(8) OJ No L 118, 29. 4. 1989, p. 23.\nANNEX\nBASIC AND BUYING-IN PRICES\n1990/91 marketing year\nPEACHES\nFor the period 1 June to 30 September 1990\n(ECU/100 kg net)\n1.2,3.4,5 //  //  //  //  // Basic price  // Buying-in price 1.2.3.4.5 //  // EUR 10   // Spain   // EUR 10   // Spain   //   //   //   //   //   // June   // 42,69   // 40,62   // 23,71  // 22,56   // July to September   // 40,30   // 38,47  // 22,58   // 21,55   //    //   //   //   //\nThese prices relate to peaches of the following varieties: Amsden, Cardinal, Charles Ingouf, Dixired, Jeronimo, J.
