A Community action programme, hereinafter called 'Programme', for improving the efficiency of electricity use shall be instituted.\n2. The Programme shall have as its twin objectives, inasmuch as this is technically and, in the long term, economically justified:\n- to influence electricity consumers in favour of the use of appliances and equipment with high electrical efficiency in the most efficient manner, and\n- to encourage further improvements in the efficiency of electrical appliances and equipment and of electricity-based processes.", "1. The action which may be taken under the Programme is summarized in the Annex.\n2. The carrying-out of any or all of those activities shall depend on the specific situation of each Member State in relation to the Community objective to be achieved as defined in Article 1.", "In the context of the management and execution of measures under the Programme in its territory each Member State shall appoint a body to recommend and coordinate the implementation of action to carry out the Programme, in cooperation with the interested parties. The Member States shall set up such bodies as necessary.", "1. The Commission shall:\n(a) coordinate, at Community level:\n- action taken under the Programme, in conjunction, where necessary, with other existing programmes;\n- the exchange of information and experience;\n(b) monitor the Programme's progress and results.\n2. In this connection, the Commission shall be responsible for technical support to the management of the Programme and for the management of actions which it takes with a view to the successful implementation of the Programme.\n3. The Commission shall report regularly to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee on the progress of the Programme and, where appropriate, on any additional measures which it envisages proposing to achieve the aims of the Programme.

The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the Chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter, if necessary by taking a vote.\nThe opinion shall be recorded in the minutes; in addition, each Member State shall have the right to ask to have its position recorded in the minutes.\nThe Commission shall take the utmost account of the opinion delivered by the Committee. It shall inform the Committee of the manner in which its opinion has been taken into account.", "If the achievement of the Programme objectives requires further Community action, the Commission shall lay before the Council any appropriate proposals for the purpose pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty.", "Before a period of three years has elapsed, the Programme and the procedures established for its implementation shall be re-examined, on the basis of a report by the Commission with a view to examining their effectiveness and their possible improvement.", "The Member States shall bring into force the provisions necessary to comply with this Decision not later than nine months after its adoption.
