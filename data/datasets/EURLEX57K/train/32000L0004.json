Normal operating requirements\nExcept as provided in Item 5.8.3, power-operated windows/roof-panel systems/partition systems may be closed under one or more of the following conditions:\n5.8.2.1. when the ignition key is inserted in the ignition control in any position of use;\n5.8.2.2. by muscular force unassisted by power supply of the vehicle;\n5.8.2.3. on continuous activation by a locking system on the outside of the vehicle;\n5.8.2.4. during the interval of time between the moment the ingnition has been switched from 'on' to 'off' and/or the key has been removed and the moment that neither of the two front doors has been opened sufficiently to permit egress of occupants;\n5.8.2.5. when the closing movement of a power-operated window, roof panel or partition starts at an opening not exceeding 4 mm;\n5.8.2.6. when the power-operated window of a vehicle's door without an upper door frame closes automatically whenever the pertinent door is closed. In this case the maximum opening, as defined in Item 2.13, prior to window closing, shall not exceed 12 mm.\n5.8.2.7. Remote closing shall be allowed by continuous activation of a remote actuation device, provided one of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n5.8.2.7.1. the remote actuation device shall be incapable of closing the power-operated window/roof panel/partition from a distance of more than 11 metres from the vehicle;\n5.8.2.7.2. the remote actuation device shall be incapable of closing the power-operated window/roof panel/partition:\n- if the actuation device and the vehicle are separated by an opaque surface\nand\n- if from the distance between the remote actuation device and the vehicle is more than 6 metres.\n5.8.2.8. One-touch closing shall be permitted only for the power-operated window of the driver's door and the roof panel, and only during the time when the ignition key is in the engine running position.\n5.8.3. Auto-reversing requirements\n5.8.3.1. None of the requirements in Item 5.8.2 shall apply if a power-operated window/roof panel system/partition is fitted with an auto-reversing device.\n5.8.3.1.1. This device shall reverse the window/roof panel/partition before it exerts a pinch force of more than 100 N within the opening of 200 mm to 4 mm above the top edge of a power-operated window/partition or in front of the leading edge of a sliding roof panel and at the trailing edge of a tilting roof panel.\n5.8.3.1.2. After such an auto-reversal, the window or roof panel or partition shall open to one of the following positions:\n5.8.3.1.2.1. a position that permits a semi-rigid cylindrical rod of a diameter of 200 mm to be placed through the opening at the same contact point(s) used to determine the reversing behaviour in Item 5.8.3.1.1;\n5.8.3.1.2.2. a position that represents at least the initial position before closing was initiated;\n5.8.3.1.2.3. a position at least 50 mm more open than the position at the time when reversing was initiated;\n5.8.3.1.2.4. in the case of tilting motion of a roof panel, the maximum angular opening.\n5.8.3.1.3. To check power-operated windows/roof-panel systems/partition systems with reversing devices, a measuring instrument/test rod shall be placed through the opening from the inside of the vehicle or, in the case of a partition system, from the rear part of the passenger compartment in such a way that the cylindrical surface of the rod contacts any part of the vehicle structure which forms the boundary of the window/roof-panel aperture/partition. The force deflection ratio of the measuring instrument shall be not more than 10 N/mm. The position of the test rods (normally located perpendicular to the window/roof panel/-partition) are illustrated in Appendix 3, Figure 1.\n5.8.4. Switch location and operation\n5.8.4.1. Switches of power-operated windows/roof panels/partitions shall be located or operated in such a way to minimise the risk of accidental closing. The switches shall require continuous actuation for closing except in the case of Items 5.8.2.6, 5.8.2.8 or 5.8.3.\n5.8.4.2. All rear-window, roof-panel and partition switches intended for use by occupants in the rear of the vehicle shall be capable of being switched off by a driver-controlled switch which is located forward of a vertical transverse plane passing through the R points of the front seats. The driver controlled switch is not required if a rear window, roof panel or partition is equipped with an auto-reversing device. If, however, the driver-controlled switch is present, it shall not be able to override the auto-reversing device.\nThe driver-controlled switch shall be located so as to minimise any accidental manipulating. It shall be identified by the symbol shown in Appendix 4.\n5.8.5. Protection devices\nAll protection devices which are used to prevent damage to the power source in the case of an overload or stalling shall be capable of resetting automatically while the switch controlling the window/roof panel/partition is activated.\n5.8.6. Handbook instructions\n5.8.6.1. The owner's manual of the vehicle shall contain clear instructions relating to the power-operated window/roof panel/partition, including:\n5.8.6.1.1. explanation of possible consequences (entrapment),\n5.8.6.1.2. use of the driver-controlled switch,\n5.8.6.1.3. a 'WARNING' message indicating the dangers, particularly to children in the case of improper use/activation of the power-operated windows/roof-panel systems/partition systems. This information should indicate the responsibilities of the driver, including instructions for other occupants and the recommendation to leave the vehicle only if the key is removed from the ignition lock,\n5.8.6.1.4. a 'WARNING' message indicating that special care should be taken when using remote closing systems (see Item 5.8.2.7), for example to actuate it only when the operator has a clear view of the vehicle to be sure that nobody can be trapped by power-operated windows/roof-panel/partition equipment\".\n(k) Items 6, 7 and 8 are replaced by the following:\n\"6. GRANTING OF EC TYPE-APPROVAL OF A VEHICLE TYPE\n6.1. If the relevant requirements are satisfied, EC type-approval shall be granted pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC.\n6.2.
