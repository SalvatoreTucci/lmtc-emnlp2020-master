Those Understandings envisaged the introduction of a tariff-only regime for the imports of bananas. To that effect, on 12 July 2004 the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate the modification of the bound tariff with a view to introducing a tariff-only regime for bananas in the EU schedule for bananas pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (\u2018GATT 1994\u2019).\n(2) On 22 March 2004 and on 29 January 2007 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations pursuant to Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994 in the course of the accession to the European Union of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia and of Bulgaria and Romania, respectively.\n(3) The negotiations were successfully concluded on 15 December 2009 by the initialling of a Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas with Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Venezuela (the \u2018Geneva Agreement\u2019) and of an Agreement on Trade in Bananas with the United States of America (the \u2018EU/US Agreement\u2019).\n(4) The Agreements negotiated by the Commission meet the claims of the countries concerned pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994.
