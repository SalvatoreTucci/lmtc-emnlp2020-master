It is necessary to amend certain provisions.\n(2) Commission Decision 2006/766/EC\u00a0(5) draws up a list of third countries which satisfy the conditions referred to in Article\u00a011(4) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0854/2004 and which are therefore able to guarantee that bivalve molluscs, tunicates, echinoderms and marine gastropods and fishery products exported to the Community meet the sanitary conditions laid down in Community legislation to protect the health of consumers.\n(3) Commission Decisions 97/20/EC\u00a0(6) and 97/296/EC\u00a0(7) allowed certain third countries which had not yet undergone a Community control to export live bivalve molluscs and fishery products into the Community under certain conditions. Those Decisions are repealed by Commission Decision 2006/765/EC\u00a0(8). This possibility is not foreseen by Regulation (EC) No\u00a0854/2004. In order to avoid any disruption of the traditional pattern of trade, that possibility should be maintained on a transitional basis.\n(4) The conditions to be applied to imports of live bivalve molluscs, tunicates, echinoderms and marine gastropods and fishery products from these third countries or territories should be at least equivalent to those governing the production and placing on the market of Community products.\n(5) Without prejudice to the general principle laid down in Chapter\u00a0II(A)(4) of Annex\u00a0II to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0854/2004 whereby live bivalve molluscs from classified B areas must not exceed the limits of 4\u00a0600E.coli per 100 g of flesh and intravalvular liquid, tolerance in 10\u00a0% of samples should be allowed for live bivalve molluscs originating from those areas. Since the tolerance in 10\u00a0% of samples does not represent a risk for public health and with a view to allowing competent authorities to adapt progressively to the scope of the relevant provisions in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0854/2004 regarding the classification of B areas, a transitional period should be granted for the classification of those areas.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No\u00a02076/2005 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a02076/2005 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article\u00a07, the following paragraphs\u00a03 and 4 are added:\n2. in Article\u00a017 the following paragraph\u00a02 is added:\n(a) the competent authority of the third country or territory has provided to the Member State concerned the guarantees that the products in question have been obtained in conditions at least equivalent to those governing the production and placing on the market of Community products and\n(b) the competent authority of the third country or territory takes appropriate measures in order to ensure that these imported products are accompanied by the model health certificates laid down in Commission Decisions 95/328/EC\u00a0(10) and 96/333/EC\u00a0(11) and marketed only on the domestic market of the importing Member State or Member States allowing the same import.\n3.
