The latest information received from the German authorities on 21 October 2009, indicated that in the most recent analysis amitraz was found at levels that largely exceeded the ARfD.\n(3) Given the high level of risk to which European consumers may be exposed, Member States should control at least 10 percent of consignments of pears originating from Turkey for the presence of amitraz at import. Consignments already on the market should also be subject to official controls.\n(4) Member States should inform the Commission of all testing results. Unfavourable results should be reported through RASFF.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 of 24 July 2009 implementing Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the increased level of official controls on imports of certain feed and food of non-animal origin and amending Decision 2006/504/EC\u00a0(3) requires Member States to carry out an increased level of controls at import on pears originating from Turkey, for the purposes of verifying the presence of amitraz on 10\u00a0% of all consignments of that commodity. As the control measure in question will be applicable as from 25 January 2010, it is appropriate to establish a duration of the measures laid down in this decision so as to avoid overlaps with the control measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 669/2009.\n(6) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.\n(7) Given the urgency it is appropriate to adopt these emergency measures in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(1) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall carry out documentary, identity and physical checks, including laboratory analysis, on at least 10 percent of consignments of fresh pears falling within CN codes 0808\u00a020\u00a010 and 0808\u00a020\u00a050 originating in or consigned from Turkey.
