It lays down the  test procedure for determining the sound-power level of such earth-moving machines with a view to  EEC type-examination and checking for conformity.\nThese technical procedures comply with the requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive  79/113/EEC, and the provisions of that Annex are applicable to earth-moving machines subject to the  following additions:\n4.CRITERIA TO BE USED FOR EXPRESSING RESULTS 4.1.Acoustic criterion for the environment The acoustic criterion for the environment of an earth-moving machine is expressed by the  sound-power level LWA.\n6.2.Operation during measurements The noise emitted is measured with the earth-moving machine stationary and its engine idling.\nFor these measurements, the engine and hydraulic system of the machine must be warmed up in  accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and safety requirements must be observed.\n6.2.1.The test is carried out with the earth-moving machine in a stationary position without  operating the working equipment or travelling mechanism. For the purposes of the test the engine  will idle at not less than the rated speed corresponding to the net power as defined and determined  in accordance with Annex I to Council Directive 80/1269/EEC of 16 December 1980.\nThe rated speed and the corresponding net power are stated by the manufacturer of the earth-moving  machine and must appear on the technical instructions for use of the earth-moving machine and on  the certificate of conformity issued to the purchaser.\nIf the earth-moving machine is fitted with several engines, they must work simultaneously during  the test provided that such simultaneous working forms part of the normal working conditions of the  machine.\nIf the engine of the earth-moving machine is fitted with a fan, the latter must operate during the  tests. If the fan can work at several speeds, the tests shall be carried out at its maximum working  speed.\nThe rated speed is set by the manufacturer. The working equipment (bucket or blade of a loader or a  dozer) is positioned at a height of 300 \u00b1 50 millimetres above the ground.\nIn the case of excavators and excavator-loaders, the working equipment must be in the retracted  position.\n6.2.2.Tests under load N\u00b0t applicable.\n6.3.Measuring site The measuring site must be flat and horizontal. This site, including the microphone positions, must  be of concrete or non-porous asphalt.\n6.4.Measuring surface, measuring distance, location and number of measuring points 6.4.1.Measuring surface, measuring distance The measuring surface to be used for the test is a hemisphere.\nThe radius of the hemisphere is determined by the basic length l, (see Fig. 1).\nThe radius is:\n-4 metres when the basic length of the earth-moving machine to be tested is not greater than 1,5 metres,\n-10 metres when the basic length of the earth-moving machine to be tested is greater than 1,5 metres but not greater than 4 metres,\n-16 metres when the basic length of the earth-moving machine to be tested is greater than 4 metres.\n6.4.2.Location and number of measuring points 6.4.2.1.General For measurements there are six measuring points, i.e. points 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 arranged as  defined in section 6.4.2.2 of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC.\nFor testing the earth-moving machine, the geometrical centre of the basic machine is positioned  vertically above the centre of the hemisphere with the front of the machine facing measuring point  1.\n7.1.1.Measurement of extraneous noise Only the backgound noise is to be taken into account for the purpose of corrections.\n7.1.5.Presence of obstacles A visual check in a circular zone having a radius three times that of the measuring hemisphere and  the same centre is adequate to ensure that the provisions of the third subparagraph of section 6.3  of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC have been complied with.\n7.2.If the sound-pressure levels at the measuring points are determined from readings taken from a  sonometer, there must be at least five such readings, taken at regular intervals.\n8.5.Calculation of the sound-power level LWA Correcting factor K2 is zero.\nANNEX II REAL, DYNAMIC METHOD OF MEASUREMENT OF AIRBORNE NOISE EMITTED BY HYDRAULIC  EXCAVATORS, ROPE-OPERATED EXCAVATORS, DOZERS, LOADERS AND EXCAVATOR-LOADERS\nThe operating  conditions of the machine correspond either to normal working conditions or to conventional working  conditions producing, in principle, effects and stress similar to those undergone under actual  working conditions.\nThe method of measurement will be established on the basis of experience and work already carried  out or under way both nationally within the Community and internationally.\nANNEX III METHOD OF MEASUREMENT AT THE OPERATOR'S POSITION OF AIRBORNE NOISE EMITTED BY  HYDRAULIC EXCAVATORS, ROPE-OPERATED EXCAVATORS, DOZERS, LOADERS AND EXCAVATOR-LOADERS\nThis method  of measurement applies to hydraulic excavators, rope-operated excavators, dozers, loaders and  excavator-loaders, hereinafter referred to as 'earth-moving machines'.
