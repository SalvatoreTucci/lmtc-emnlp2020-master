On the other hand, paragraph 32 states that the presentation in capsules is \u2018a decisive factor which reveals their function as a food supplement, since it determines the dosage of the edible preparations, the way in which they are absorbed and the place where they are supposed to become active\u2019.\n(4) Consequently, pursuant to the Court's ruling, products that are used as food supplements to maintain general health or well-being and that are presented in capsules are classified under heading 2106 as \u2018food preparations not elsewhere specified or included\u2019.\n(5) However, tariff classification problems could occur in case of the classification of products with the same composition, the same purpose, containing a measured dose, but presented in tablets, pastilles or pills.\n(6) Therefore, in order to ensure a consistent interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the classification of food preparations presented in measures doses, such as capsules, tablets, pastilles and pills and which are intended for use as food supplements, should take into account the criteria developed in Joined Cases C-410/08 to C-412/08 (\u2018Swiss Caps\u2019).\n(7) Consequently, a new Additional Note should be inserted in Chapter 21 of the Combined Nomenclature to ensure a uniform interpretation throughout the territory of the Union.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["In Chapter 21 of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, the following Additional Note 5 is inserted:\n\u20185.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 2013.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1."}
