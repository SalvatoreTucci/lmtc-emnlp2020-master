Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that all new heat generators for space heating and/or the production of hot water in new or existing non-industrial buildings comply with minimum performance requirements.\nIn the case of generators capable of using various forms of energy, the minimum performance requirements must relate to each form of energy used.  (1)OJ No C 266, 7.11.1977, p. 55. (2)OJ No C 287, 30.11.1977, p. 9. (3)OJ No C 153, 9.7.1975, p. 1. (4)OJ No C 153, 9.7.1975, p. 5. (5)OJ No L 140, 28.5.1976, p. 12.\nThe term heat generator shall, in particular, mean hot-water boilers, steam boilers, air heaters, including components and especially the associated firing equipment appropriate to the type of fossil fuel used. Combined electricity/heat generators used in buildings shall also be regarded as heat generators ; for these, the minimum performance requirements must relate to the full energy output.\nElectric heat generators with resistances and connections to a remote heating network shall be excluded.\nThose appliances for which type-testing is not practicable will be the subject of a subsequent proposal after appropriate technical study.\n2. Member States shall ensure that compliance with the minimum performance requirements is assured by an inspection carried out either at the stage of manufacture of the generator or at the time of installation.\n3. Heat generators subject to inspection at the time of manufacture cannot be offered for sale unless they comply with the minimum performance requirements ; compliance with the relevant rules shall be certified by means of a data plate giving the following minimum details:    - manufacturer's identity,\n- type of heat generator and its year of manufacture,\n- heat rating in kW for every type of energy foreseen,\n- type and characteristics of the energy or energies used,\n- maximum temperature of the heating fluid,\n- confirmation of inspection and identification of the body which carried it out,\n- consumption of each heat generator when working to rated capacity.\nThe term \"heat rating\" refers to the highest output that can be continuously supplied by the heat generator.\nWhen a heat generator of a type subject to inspection at the time of manufacture is installed, the user shall be provided with written operating and maintenance instructions to enable him to obtain optimum efficiency. These instructions must have been inspected in the same way as the generator and include the main details of the findings of the inspection.\n4. In the case of heat generators subject to inspection at the time of installation, energy losses must not exceed the levels laid down by the Member States.", "Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that economically justifiable insulation of the distribution and storage system is made compulsory in new non-industrial buildings, both as regards heating fluid and domestic hot water.\nThese provisions shall also apply to systems connected to a remote-heating network.\nThey shall also apply to new heat generators, including electric systems for heating water, in all new or existing non-industrial buildings.", "The date from which a heat generator may no longer be installed, unless it complies with the minimum performance requirements in accordance with Article 1, shall be 1 January 1981.\nThe measures referred to in Article 2 shall apply from 1 July 1980.", "The Member States shall duly inform the Commission of measures taken within the scope of this Directive and of the results obtained or anticipated from such measures.", "This Directive shall in no way prejudge measures based on Article 100 of the Treaty.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 February 1978.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP.
