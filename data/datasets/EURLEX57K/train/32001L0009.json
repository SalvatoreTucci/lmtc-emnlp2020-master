Similarly, OBD systems will be required for new diesel vehicles from 2003.\n(5) The development of OBDs capable of monitoring and recording vehicle faults during operation should narrow the gap between test conditions and actual operation in the future.\n(6) This Directive abolishes the need to test petrol driven vehicles at low idle speed thus reducing the complexity of the test, but increasing accuracy through monitoring the functioning of the vehicle's OBD system.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the committee for the adaptation to technical progress of the Directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers instituted by Article 8 of Directive 96/96/EC,", "main_body": ["Directive 96/96/EC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive one year after the entry into force of the Directive at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.\nMember States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law that they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 February 2001.\nFor the Commission\nLoyola De Palacio\nVice-President\n(1) OJ L 46, 17.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 142, 5.6.1999, p. 26.\n(3) OJ L 350, 28.12.1998, p. 1.\nANNEX\nPoint 8.2.1(b)(4) of Annex II to Directive 96/96/EC is replaced by the following: \"4. Exhaust pipe emissions - limit values\n(a) Measurement at engine idling speed:\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the vehicle manufacturer. Where this information is not available, the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,5 % vol.\n(b) Measurement at high idle speed, engine speed to be at least 2000 revs/min.:\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the vehicle manufacturer at high idle speed. Where this is not available, the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,3 % vol.\nThe air/fuel ratio, Lambda shall be = 1 +- 3 % or in accordance with manufacturer's specifications.\n(c) For motor vehicles equipped with on-board diagnostic systems in accordance with Directive 98/69/EC, Member States may as an alternative to the test specified in item (a) establish the correct functioning of the emission system through the appropriate reading of the OBD device and simultaneous checking of the proper functioning of the OBD system.\""}
