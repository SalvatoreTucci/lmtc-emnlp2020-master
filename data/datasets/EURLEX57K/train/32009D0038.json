Traces is a computerised system introduced by Commission Decision 2004/292/EC of 30 March 2004 on the introduction of the Traces system and amending Decision 92/486/EEC\u00a0(5). It replaces the previous Animo system, based on the network introduced by Commission Decision 91/398/EEC of 19 July 1991 on a computerised network linking veterinary authorities (Animo)\u00a0(6), for tracing movements of animals and certain products in intra-Community trade and imports.\n(3) The Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\u00a0(7) (the Agreement) entered into force on 1 June 2002. Annex 11 to that Agreement concerns measures for the control and notification of certain animal diseases and trade in and imports from third countries of live animals, their semen, ova and embryos.\n(4) The Agreement provides for the setting up of a Joint Veterinary Committee, made up of representatives of the Parties thereto. That Committee is to consider any matter arising in connection with Annex 11 to the Agreement and with its implementation. It may decide to amend the appendices thereto, in particular with a view to their adaptation and updating.\n(5) Annex 11 to the Agreement was amended by a new Agreement. That new Agreement was signed and is provisionally applied by the Community on the basis of Council Decision 2008/979/EC of 18 December 2008 on the signing on behalf of the Community and the provisional application of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending Annex 11 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\u00a0(8).\n(6) In addition, The Council amended the relevant appendices to Annex 11 to the Agreement by its Decision 2009/13/EC\u00a0(9) on the Community position on Decision No 1/2008 of the Joint Veterinary Committee set up by the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products regarding the amendment of Appendices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 to Annex 11 to the Agreement. As a consequence of those amendments, certain border inspection posts in Germany, France, Italy and Austria will have to cease veterinary checks on relevant consignments coming from Switzerland.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate that the entries for the border inspections posts to Switzerland in Germany: Konstanz Stra\u00dfe and Weil/Rhein; in France: Ferney-Voltaire (Gen\u00e8ve), Saint-Louis B\u00e2le (airport and road) and Saint-Julien Bardonnex; in Italy: Campocologno, Chiasso (road and rail) and Gran San Bernardo-Pollein; and in Austria: Feldkirch-Buchs, Feldkirch-Tisis and H\u00f6chst be deleted from the list of border inspection posts set out in the Annex to Decision 2001/881/EC.\n(8) The list of units in Commission Decision 2002/459/EC of 4 June 2002 listing the units in the Animo computer network and repealing Decision 2000/287/EC\u00a0(10) includes the Traces unit number of each border inspection post in the Community. In the interests of consistency of Community legislation, that list should, accordingly, be updated to take account of amendments to be made to the Annex to Decision 2001/881/EC so that the information contained in those two Annexes is identical.\n(9) Decisions 2001/881/EC and 2002/459/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2001/881/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision.", "The Annex to Decision 2002/459/EC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 January 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 56.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 9.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 326, 11.12.2001, p. 44.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 94, 31.3.2004, p. 63.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 221, 9.8.1991, p. 30.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 114, 30.4.2002, p. 132.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 352, 31.12.2008, p. 23.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 6, 10.1.2009, p. 89.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 159, 17.6.2002, p. 27.\nANNEX I\nThe Annex to Decision 2001/881/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in the section on border inspection posts in Germany, the following entries are deleted:\n\u2018Konstanz Stra\u00dfe DE 53199 R  HC, NHC U, E, O\nWeil/Rhein DE 49199 R  HC, NHC U, E, O\u2019\n2. in the section on border inspection posts in France, the following entries are deleted:\n\u2018Ferney\u2013Voltaire (Gen\u00e8ve) FR 20199 A  HC-T(1)(2), HC-NT, NHC O\nSaint Louis B\u00e2le FR 26899 A  HC-T(1), HC-NT, NHC O\nSaint Louis B\u00e2le FR 16899 R  HC-T(1), HC-NT, NHC\nSaint-Julien Bardonnex FR 17499 R  HC-T(1), HC-NT, NHC U, O\u2019\n3.
