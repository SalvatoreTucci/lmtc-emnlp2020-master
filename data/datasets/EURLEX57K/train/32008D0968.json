In that report it came to the conclusion that arachidonic acid-rich oil from Mortierella alpina can safely be used in infant formulae and formulae for premature infants.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 17 November 2005.\n(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.\n(5) Therefore the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on 26 June 2007.\n(6) On 10 July 2008 EFSA adopted the \u2018Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies on a request from the Commission related to the safety of \u201cfungal oil from Mortierella alpina\u201d.\u2019\n(7) In the opinion the EFSA came to the conclusion that the fungal oil from Mortierella alpina is a safe source of arachidonic acid to be used in infant formulae and follow-on formulae.\n(8) Annex I and Annex II to Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae and amending Directive 1999/21/EC\u00a0(2) specify the rules for the addition of long chain (20 and 22 carbon atoms) polyunsaturated fatty acids and in particular of arachidonic acid to infant formulae and follow-on formulae.\n(9) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that fungal oil from Mortierella alpina complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Fungal oil from Mortierella alpina as specified in the Annex may be placed on the market in the Community as a novel food ingredient to be used in infant formulae and follow-on formulae as defined in Article 2 of Directive 2006/141/EC and in formulae for premature infants.\nThe addition of fungal oil from Mortierella alpina to infant formulae and follow-on formulae shall be limited by its content of arachidonic acid according to the rules specified in Annex I, 5.7 and in Annex II, 4.7 to Directive 2006/141/EC.
