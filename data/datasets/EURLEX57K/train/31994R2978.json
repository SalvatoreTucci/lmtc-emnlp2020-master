whereas the method of measuring the tonnage of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers has been developed further by the IMO;\nWhereas all but one of the Member States have ratified and implemented the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 and the Protocol of 1978 related thereto (Marpol 73/78);

whereas it is desirable to  promote the use of double hull oil tankers or oil tankers of an alternative design fulfilling the requirements of Regulation 13F of Annex I of Marpol 73/78 as amended on 6 March 1992, as well as segregated ballast oil tankers;\nWhereas double hull oil tankers and oil tankers of an alternative design should be treated for the purpose of this Regulation as if their segregated ballast tanks complied with Regulation 13 of Annex I of Marpol 73/78;\nWhereas it is inappropriate to penalize shipowners and operators for using oil tankers which are environmentally-friendly in design and operation;\nWhereas, in particular, the charging of dues on the tonnage of segregated ballast tanks of oil tankers, where those tanks are not used for the carriage of cargo, constitutes a financial disadvantage for those who have taken an important step towards a  cleaner environment;\nWhereas, for economic reasons, individual harbour authorities are reluctant to be placed at a disadvantage by being the only ones to implement the IMO Resolution;\nWhereas IMO Resolutions A.722(17) and A.747(18) have been agreed, but not implemented by all Member States;\nWhereas for the purpose of protecting the marine environment from pollution by oil tankers of a conventional design, there should be unified implementaion in the Community of internationally agreed rules concerning the charging of levies on oil tankers  by port and harbour authorities and pilotage authorities;\nWhereas, in order to avoid distortion of competition within the Community and to reach efficient and cost-effective solutions, concerted action for unified implementation of the internationally agreed rules, in accordance with the principle of  subsidiarity, can best be established by means of a Regulation;\nWhereas the flag State or other bodies issuing the International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate and the International Tonnage Certificate (1969), as well as the shipowners and persons who charge levies on oil tankers must work togehter in  implementing IMO Resolution A.747(18) in order to enhance protection of the marine environment;\nWhereas systems have already been established in some Member States for reducing levies on environmentally-friendly vessels on a basis other than IMO Resolution A.747(18);

The ship is certified as a segregated ballast oil tanker as stated in paragraph 5 of the supplement to the International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate and the location of the segregated ballast tanks is indicated under paragraph 5.2 of the  supplement.\n2. Segregated ballast tanks are those tanks exclusively used for the carriage of segregated water ballast, as defined in Regulation 1 (17) of Annex I of Marpol 73/78. The segregated ballast tanks should have a separate ballast pumping and piping system  arranged for the intake and discharge of ballast water from and to the sea only. There should be no piping connections from segregated ballast tanks to the fresh water system. No segregated ballast tank should be used for the carriage of any cargo or  for storage of ship's stores or material.\n3. In the International Tonnage Certificate (1969) under 'Remarks' an entry is made for the tonnage of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers as follows:\n'The segregated ballast tanks comply with Regulation 13 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, and the total tonnage of such tanks exclusively  used for the carriage of segregated water ballast is... .\nThe reduced gross tonnage which should be used for the calculation of tonnage based fees is ... .'\n4. The tonnage of segregated ballast tanks mentioned above shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nK1 x Vb\nwhere:\nK1 = 0,2 + 0,02 log10 V (or as tabulated in Appendix 2 of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969).\nV = the total volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship in cubic metres as defined in Regulation 3 of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.\nVb = the total volume of segregated ballast tanks in cubic metres measured in accordance with Regulation 6 of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.\nANNEX II\nDefinitions given by Marpol 73/78 to the terms in Article 3 (1) (a), (b), (e) and (f)  Re paragraph 1 (a):\n'Oil tankers' means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry oil in bulk in its cargo spaces and includes combination carriers and any 'chemical tanker' as defined in Annex II of the present Convention, when it is carrying a cargo or part cargo  of oil in bulk.\n'Combination carrier' means a ship designed to carry either oil or solid cargoes in bulk.\n'Chemical tanker' means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry a cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk and includes an 'oil tanker' as defined in Annex I of the present Convention when carrying a cargo or part cargo of noxious liquid  substances in bulk.\nRe paragraph 1 (b):\n'Segregated ballast' means the ballast water introduced into a tank which is completely separated from the cargo oil and oil fuel system and which is permanently allocated to the carriage of ballast or to the carriage of ballast or cargoes other than  oil or noxious substances as variously defined in the Annexes of the present Convention.\nRe paragraph 1 (e):\n'Double hull oil tanker' means an oil tanker of which the entire cargo tank length shall be protected by ballast tanks or spaces other than cargo and fuel oil tanks.\nRe paragraph 1 (f):\n'Oil tanker of an alternative design' means:\n- an oil tanker, the design of which is such that the cargo and vapour pressure exerted on the bottom shell plating forming a single boundary between the cargo and the sea does not exceed the external hydrostatic water pressure,\n- an oil tanker which is designed according to methods that ensure at least the same level of protection against oil pollution in the event of collision or stranding and are approved in principle by the Marine Environment Protection Committee based on  guidelines developed by the International Maritime Organization."}
