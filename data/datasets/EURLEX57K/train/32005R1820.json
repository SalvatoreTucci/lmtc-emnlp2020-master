In order to enable the highest selling price to be obtained for such alcohol, the conditions for competition on the wine alcohol market should be improved.\n(2) To that end, firstly, an increase in the number of tenderers should be encouraged by simplifying the approval procedure. Secondly, where applicable, those undertakings should have the possibility of freely choosing on the market the clients to whom they will sell on the processed alcohol for its final use.\n(3) To that end, tenderers should not be required, on presentation of their tenders, to indicate the destination and the final purchasers of the alcohol, provided that final use takes place in the form of bio-ethanol in the fuel sector in the Community.\n(4) In order to better ensure that the planned final use of the alcohol is complied with, the amount of the performance guarantee should be increased.\n(5) The conditions for the participation of undertakings in invitations to tender as regards the date of their approval should be set out in greater detail.\n(6) The exchange of information between the intervention agencies, the Member States and the Commission should be made more transparent and efficient.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 is amended as follows:\n1.
