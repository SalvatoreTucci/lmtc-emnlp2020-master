Indeed collection of material from the seabed would damage the target species and make the selection of the fished species virtually impossible due to their very small size.\n(11) The derogation requested by Spain affects a limited number of vessels, since only 29 vessels are involved.\n(12) The fishing activities concerned fulfil the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 concerning protected habitats which, by way of derogation, allows fishing above those habitats if fishing is operated without touching the seagrass bed under certain conditions.\n(13) The requirements of Article 8(1)(h) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 are not applicable since they relate to trawlers.\n(14) Since the fishing activities concerned are highly selective, have a negligible effect on the environment and are not affected by provisions in Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006, they are eligible for the derogation to the minimum mesh size referred to in Article 9(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006. Therefore, the minimum mesh size rules set by Article 9(3) do not apply.\n(15) The Spanish management plan includes measures for the monitoring of fishing activities, thus fulfilling the conditions set out in Article 13(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 and in Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\u00a0(3).\n(16) The fishing activities concerned take place at a very short distance from the coast and therefore do not interfere with the activities of other vessels.\n(17) The Spanish management plan ensures that catches of species mentioned in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 are minimal and that the fishing activities do not target cephalopods.\n(18) Therefore, the requested derogation should be granted.\n(19) Spain should report to the Commission in due time and in accordance with the monitoring plan provided for in the Spanish management plan.\n(20) In line with the request by Spain, a limitation in duration of the derogation will allow ensuring prompt corrective management measures in case the report to the Commission will show a poor conservation status of the exploited stock while providing scope to improve the scientific basis for an improved management plan.\n(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 shall not apply, in territorial waters of Spain adjacent to the coast of the Autonomous Community of Murcia, to fishing for transparent goby (Aphia minuta) by boat seines which are used by vessels:\n(a) registered in the maritime census managed by the Directorate-General for Livestock and Fisheries of the Autonomous Community of Murcia;\n(b) having a track record in the fishery of more than five years and not involving any future increase in fishing effort provided; and\n(c) holding a fishing authorisation and operating under the management plan adopted by Spain in accordance with Article 19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the management plan\u2019).\nThis derogation shall apply for a period of three years following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.", "Monitoring plan and report\nSpain shall communicate to the Commission, within three years following the entry into force of this Regulation, a report drawn up in accordance with the monitoring plan established in the management plan referred to in Article 1(c).", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 August 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 409, 30.12.2006, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Orden de 27 de marzo de 2013 de la Consejer\u00eda de Agricultura y Agua, por la que se regula la pesquer\u00eda del chanquete (Aphia minuta) en aguas interiores de la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia\u2019, Murcia\u2019s region OJ number 78, 6.4.2013, p. 13950.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1."}
