Those electronic portals should have been operational from 1 January 2010.\n(3) A number of serious delays and certain technical problems have affected the development and operation of the electronic portals in a limited number of Member States, thereby preventing the timely submission of certain refund applications. Pursuant to Directive 2008/9/EC, refund applications are to be submitted to the Member State of establishment at the latest on 30 September of the calendar year following the refund period. Given that deadline, and the inoperability of some of the electronic portals, some taxable persons risk being unable to exercise their right to deduct VAT on expenses incurred in 2009. The deadline should therefore exceptionally be extended to 31 March 2011 for applications relating to refund periods in 2009.\n(4) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\u00a0(4), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Union, their own tables which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(5) In order to ensure that taxable persons will not be required to meet the deadline of 30 September 2010 in respect of applications relating to refund periods in 2009, this Directive should apply from 1 October 2010.\n(6) Directive 2008/9/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Article 15(1) of Directive 2008/9/EC the following subparagraph shall be added:\n\u2018Refund applications which relate to refund periods in 2009 shall be submitted to the Member State of establishment on 31 March 2011 at the latest.\u2019.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive with effect from 1 October 2010.
