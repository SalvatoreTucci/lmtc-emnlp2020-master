Hence Greenland no longer fulfils the requirements for being recognised as being officially brucellosis free.\n(6) Decision 97/232/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part 5 of the Annex to Decision 97/232/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 5 November 2003.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 October 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 302, 31.12.1972, p. 28.\n(2) OJ L 122, 16.5.2003, p. 36.\n(3) OJ L 46, 19.2.1991, p. 19.\n(4) OJ L 122, 16.5.2003, p. 1.\n(5) OJ L 93, 8.4.1997, p. 43.\n(6) OJ L 45, 19.2.2003, p. 25.\nANNEX\n\"PART 5 Non-member countries or parts of non-member countries recognised as satisfying the criteria for officially brucellosis-free status\nCzech Republic\nHungary\nRomania\nSlovak Republic\""}
