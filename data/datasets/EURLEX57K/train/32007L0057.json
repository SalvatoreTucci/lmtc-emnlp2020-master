Information about new or changed uses has been communicated to the Commission, which should lead to changes in the residue levels of maneb, mancozeb, metiram, propineb and thiram.\n(3) The active substance ziram has been included in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC\u00a0(5) by Commission Directive 2003/81/EC\u00a0(6). The inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC was based on the assessment of the information submitted concerning the proposed use. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain MRLs to be fixed.\n(4) There are already Community MRLs in Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC for maneb, mancozeb, metiram, propineb and thiram. Those levels have been taken into consideration when adapting the MRLs concerned by this Directive. In particular, as in routine monitoring the residues of maneb, mancozeb, metiram, propineb, thiram and ziram cannot be individually identified, MRLs are set for the whole group of those pesticides which are also known as dithiocarbamates. However, for propineb, thiram and ziram single methods exist, although not on a routine basis. Those methods should be used on a case-by-case basis, when the specific quantification of propineb, ziram and/or thiram is required.\n(5) The Commission review reports which were prepared for the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned, fix the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and, if necessary, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) for those substances. The exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substance concerned has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(7) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants\u00a0(8) on the methodology employed. It has been concluded that the MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADI or ARfD being exceeded.\n(6) Where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residues in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data, MRLs should be fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(7) It is therefore necessary to modify the MRLs set out in the Annexes to Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer. Where MRLs have already been defined in the Annexes to those Directives, it is appropriate to amend them. Where MRLs have not already been defined, it is appropriate to set them for the first time.\n(8) Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC the entry relating to thiram is deleted.", "Directive 86/362/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Directive.", "Directive 86/363/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Directive.", "Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex III to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish, by 18 March 2008 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
