Retroactive application should therefore be necessary with effect from 1\u00a0August 2006, which is the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01081/2006.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01081/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Paragraph\u00a03 of Article\u00a011 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01081/2006 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. point\u00a0(b) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) in the case of grants:\n(i) indirect costs, declared on a flat-rate basis, of up to\u00a020\u00a0% of the direct costs of an operation;\n(ii) flat-rate costs calculated by application of standard scales of unit cost as defined by the Member State;\n(iii) lump sums to cover all or part of the costs of an operation;\u2019;\n2. the following subparagraphs shall be added:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nHowever, it shall apply with effect from 1\u00a0August 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 6\u00a0May 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.
