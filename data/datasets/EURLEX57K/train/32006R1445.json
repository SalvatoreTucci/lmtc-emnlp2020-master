This additive was subsequently entered in the Community Register of Feed Additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application for an amendment of the authorisation of that preparation was submitted to allow its use in feed containing the following coccidiostats: diclazuril (Clinacox 0,5\u00a0% and Clinacox 0,2\u00a0%), narasin-nicarbazina (Maxiban G160) and maduramicin ammonium (Cygro 1\u00a0%) for chickens for fattening. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 5 November 2005 that the compatibility of the additive Bacillus var. toyoi (NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012) with diclazuril (Clinacox 0,5\u00a0% and Clinacox 0,2\u00a0%), narasin-nicarbazina (Maxiban G160) and maduramicin ammonium (Cygro 1\u00a0%) was established\u00a0(4). The opinion of the Authority also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 September 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
