whereas it is consequently appropriate, for reasons of  clarity, to replace Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2695/77 by a new regulation taking over the new  nomenclature as well as the\nnew legal base; whereas, for the same reason, it is appropriate  to incorporate in this new text all the amendments made to date;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2658/87 lays down that duties on products specified in Section A of  Annex 1 to this Regulation are suspended when the products are intended to be fitted in aircraft  imported duty free or built within the Community; whereas the suspension shall be subject to  conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions; whereas such conditions shall also apply  to the granting of a favourable tariff arrangement to goods intended for use in civil aircraft and  for incorporation therein in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding,  modification or conversion, covered by Section II B of the Preliminary Provisions of the combined  nomenclature, or by autonomous Community tariff suspensions;\nWhereas, in Section II (A) of its preliminary provisions, the combined nomenclature also provides  that customs duties are suspended in respect of goods intended for incorporation in certain  categories of ships, boats or other vessels, for the purposes of their construction, repair,  maintenance or conversion, and in respect of goods intended for fitting to or equipping such ships,  boats or other vessels; whereas the suspension shall be subject to conditions laid down in the  relevant Community provisions with a view to customs control of the use of such goods;\nWhereas, in order to ensure uniform application of the combined nomenclature, provisions are  necessary for fixing those conditions;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 4142/87 of 9 December 1987 determining the conditions under  which certain goods are eligible on import for a favourable tariff arrangement by reason of their  end-use (9), sets out both the general and minimum conditions governing such goods; whereas that  Regulation should be applied to the products referred to above;\nWhereas, nevertheless, for goods for the maintenance or repair of aircraft, consigned by air from  one Member State to another by airlines engaged in international traffic, whether the goods are to  be transferred for the airlines' own needs or under the terms of exchange agreements; it is  necessary to simplify the formalities involved in the internal Community transit procedure under  which these goods are consigned, and in view of the specialized nature of these movements of goods,  more flexible arrangements than those of Control Copy T 5 are necessary;\nWhereas, however, in view of the special requirements arising out of the particular end-use of the  products in question, special provisions are needed to cover, on the one hand, an extension of the  period within which the goods must be used and, on the other hand, a broadening of the scope of the  provisions whereby the goods may be put to a use other than the end-use provided for or may be  exported outside the customs territory of the Community;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the  Nomenclature Committee and of the Committee on the Movement of Goods,", "main_body": ["Subject to the provisions of Articles 2 to 10 hereunder, Commission  Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 4142/87 shall apply to the products listed in Annexes I and II to this  Regulation.", "Notwithstanding Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 4142/87, the period within which the  goods must be put to the prescribed use shall be five years.", "Notwithstanding Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 4142/87, but without prejudice to the  provisions in force regarding the control of goods on importation and exportation, Control Copy T 5  need not be used in the case of goods for the maintenance and repair of aircraft, consigned by air  from one Member State to another, whether under the terms of exchange agreements or for airlines'  own needs, by airlines engaged in international traffic.
