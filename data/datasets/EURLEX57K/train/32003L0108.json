Where such waste is not replaced by new products, the responsibility should be borne by those users. Member States, producers and users should have the possibility to make alternative arrangements.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 17 of Directive 2002/96/EC, Member States are to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with that Directive by 13 August 2004. In order to avoid having to amend Member States' legislation adopted by that date, this Directive should be adopted as soon as possible and implemented in Member States' legislation at the same time as Directive 2002/96/EC.\n(6) Directive 2002/96/EC should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Article 9 of Directive 2002/96/EC shall be replaced by the following:\n\"Article 9\nFinancing in respect of WEEE from users other than private households\n1.

Member States may, as an alternative, provide that users other than private households also be made, partly or totally, responsible for this financing.\nFor other historical waste, the financing of the costs shall be provided for by the users other than private households.\n2.
