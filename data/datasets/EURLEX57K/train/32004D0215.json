As many infections with that virus run a subclinical course, control measures should be directed to the eradication of the infection rather than to the suppression of symptoms.\n(2) Part II of Annex E to Directive 64/432/EEC lists \"infectious bovine rhinotracheitis\" among the diseases for which national control programmes may be approved and additional guarantees requested.\n(3) Germany has submitted a programme conducted with the aim of eradicating the BHV1 infection in all parts of its territory, which complies with the criteria set out in Article 9(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC and provides for rules for the national movement of bovine animals which are equivalent to those previously implemented in Denmark, Austria, the Province of Bolzano in Italy and Sweden which were successful in eradicating the disease from those countries.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to approve the programme presented by Germany and, as requested by that Member State, to define at the same time additional guarantees in relation to trade in bovine animals in order to secure the success of that programme.\n(5) Additional guarantees exist as regards Denmark, Austria, Finland and Sweden as well as Italy, concerning the province of Bolzano. Those Member States consider that their territory is free from infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and Italy takes the same view for the Province of Bolzano. In accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC, they submitted supporting documentation to the Commission, in particular substantiating that monitoring of the situation is continued.\n(6) To Member States or regions thereof that are recognised as being free of that disease and which are currently listed in the Annex to Commission Decision 93/42/EEC(2) only minimum requirements for the dispatch of bovine animals for breeding and production to other Member States should apply.\n(7) For the standardisation of BHV1 tests in laboratories the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has adopted a strong positive, a weak positive and negative serum as OIE international standards for BHV1 tests which are available at the OIE Reference Laboratories for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis mentioned in the Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines(3).\n(8) Until 1 May 2004 when modified animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports into the Community of bovine animals come into force it must be ensured that the reference to Decision 93/42/EEC providing for the additional guarantees with regard to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis for bovine animals coming from third countries is construed as reference to the relevant provisions of the present Decision.\n(9) It is appropriate to combine in a single Decision the approval of the German programme and the additional guarantees for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Decision 93/42/EEC should therefore be repealed.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The programmes presented by the Member States listed in the first column of the table in Annex I for the control and eradication of the infection with the bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV1), hereinafter referred to as \"infectious bovine rhinotracheitis\", in regions of these Member States specified in the second column of the table in Annex I are approved.", "1.
