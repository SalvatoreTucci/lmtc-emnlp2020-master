These rules allow for the terms of the European sample schemes to be adapted to changes of the base year.\n(3) The weightings for producing the European aggregates of all short-term statistics indicators were updated in 2013. This base-year change gave rise to a review of the NACE activity and CPA product headings selected for the individual Member States participating in the European sample schemes. The selection of NACE activity and CPA product headings should be adapted in order to reflect changes in recent years in the relevance of individual NACE activity and CPA product headings.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 657/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 657/2007 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0162, 5.6.1998, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 657/2007 of 14 June 2007 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 concerning short-term statistics as regards the establishment of European sample schemes (OJ L\u00a0155, 15.6.2007, p.\u00a07).\nANNEX\nThe first reference period for the new headings referred to in the following tables shall be no later than January 2015 with effect from the introduction of base year 2015, before the end of 2018.\n312\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OUTPUT PRICES ON THE NON-DOMESTIC MARKET\nMember State Data scope in the European sample scheme (NACE Rev. 2)\nBelgium 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 35\nIreland 10, 11, 18, 20, 21, 26, 28, 32\nCyprus 10, 21\nMalta 26\nFinland 10, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28\nSlovenia 21, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29\n340\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IMPORT PRICES\nMember State Data scope in the European sample scheme (CPA)\nBelgium 05.10, 06.10, 06.20, 07.10, 07.20, 08.99, 10.20, 14.13, 14.14, 15.20, 17.12, 19.20, 20.13, 20.14, 20.15, 20.16, 20.59, 21.10, 21.20, 22.11, 24.10, 24.42, 24.44, 26.11, 26.20, 26.30, 26.40, 26.51, 28.11, 28.13, 28.23, 28.29, 28.92, 29.10, 29.32, 31.09, 32.12, 32.50\nIreland 06.10, 06.20, 19.20, 20.14, 21.10, 21.20, 26.20, 32.50\nCyprus 19.20\nLuxembourg 26.20, 26.30\nMalta 19.20, 26.11\nAustria 06.10, 21.10, 21.20, 24.41, 26.20, 26.30, 29.10, 29.32\nPortugal 06.10, 19.20, 29.10\nFinland 06.10, 06.20, 07.20, 19.20, 21.20, 26.20, 26.30, 29.10\nSlovenia 19.20, 29.10"}
