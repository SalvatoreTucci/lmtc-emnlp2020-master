Member States shall deliver  data on main areas and secondary areas, in accordance with the definitions given in Annex I,  annualy for all types of use of arable land listed in Annex II. Only the Member States indicated in  Annex IX shall be obliged to include secondary areas in an annual statistical survey and to deliver  data on those areas.\n2.  In addition, Member States shall submit data on main areas of permanent grassland and permanent  crops and other areas as stated respectively in Annex II, headings K, L, M and N. Those data can be  obtained fully or partially from earth observation techniques and sources other than the  comprehensive survey mentioned in Article 3 (1), and such sources need not necessarily be annual  surveys.\n3.  Each Member State shall also sumbit annual data on the following:\n-  average yield, and -  production harvested, for each product as specified in Annex III.\nSECTION III\nMethods, and specifications", "1.  For the specification in each Member  State of the use of arable land referred to in Annex II, data on the main areas shall be obtained  from one comprehensive annual statistical survey which should take the form of a census or a  representative survey. That survey may include the other utilized agricultural area apart from  arable land.\n2.  After approval by the Commission, Member States may, however, use adminsitrative sources as a  substitute for data on arable land obtained from the comprehensive survey mentioned in paragraph  1.\n3.  Where neither statistical surveys on permanent crops, permanent grassland and other parts of  the utilized agricultural area (as defined in Annex II, headings K, L, M and N) for a specific year  nor annual estimates on changes in land use of those items from Community sources are available,  Member States may provide estimates for that year for those items.\n4.  The general survey referred to in paragraph 1 shall be conducted using statistically recognized  methods which meet the requirements on quality, objectivity and reliability.\n5.  The Member States listed in Annex IX may choose between two different methodological approaches  for the land use survey according to the definitions in Annex I:\n-  either a 'real-time` approach referring to the main area at the time of the survey with  additional information on secondary area later on,\n-  or an 'ex-post` evaluation of land use (referring to main and secondary area in the same survey)  taking place at the end of the crop season. Only Member States referred to in Annex IX have to  specify secondary areas.\n6.  Data for areas of marginal importance, as referred to in Annex VIII, may be obtained from other  data sources not meeting all the requirements of this Regulation.\n7.  In order to meet the requirements of this section, transitional arrangements may be agreed upon  in accordance with Article 8 (3).", "1.  In the case of sample surveys on main areas of arable land, the samples must be  designed so that they are representative of at least 95  % of the total area of that land under  crops other than cereals.\nData on the main areas must be supplemented by an estimate relying on data from other sources and  relating to the area of arable land not covered by the sample and under crops other than cereals.\n2.  Surveys on land under permanent grassland, permanent crops and other parts of the utilized  agricultural area apart from arable land shall be as representative as possible. Permanent  grassland shall also include the parts of the utilized agricultural area outside agricultural  holdings.\n3.  The sample surveys on main areas of arable land must be designed so that, in each Member State  and for each of the separate groups of main areas (as specified in Annex IV) at least one of the  following two criteria is satisfied:\n(a)  the coefficient of variation does not exceed that given in Annex IV;\n(b)  the standard error does not exceed that given in Annex IV.\n4.  The degree of accuracy required for the area estimates of permanent grassland, permanent crops  and other parts of the utilized agricultural area apart from arable land shall be decided in  accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12, once the Member States have forwarded to the  Commission the reports referred to in Article 8 (1).", "1.  Surveys on production or yields shall be conducted using statistically recognized  methods as regards quality, objectivity and reliability.\n2.  After approval by the Commission, Member States may, however, use administrative sources as  substitutes for the data obtained from the surveys on production or yields as mentioned in  paragraph 1.\n3.  The degree of accuracy to be required for the production estimate of each crop in Annex III  shall be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12, once the Member States  have forwarded to the Commission the reports referred to in Article 8 (1).\n4.  Any supplementary information required for the further standardization of production estimates  shall be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12, once the Member States  have forwarded to the Commission the reports referred to in Article 8 (1).\nSECTION IV\nData to be supplied at regional level", "1.  Annual data on areas under  cultivation, yields and harvested production must be forwarded to the Commission for the crops  indicated in Annex V at the regional levels defined in Annex VI. Areas under cultivation are  defined in Annex V.\nWhere no regional data are available for a specific year in respect of permanent crops, permanent  grassland and other parts of the utilized agricultural area (as defined in Annex II headings K, L,  M and N) Member States may supply estimates for that year in respect of those items, as specified  in Annex V.\n2.  Member States shall be obliged to supply data on areas and products only in respect of crops of  which the area exceeds the level of marginal importance as indicated in Annex VIII.\n3.  Member States shall be obliged to supply data on areas under cultivation as defined in Annex V  and on harvested production only in respect of the most important regions for each of the specified  crops. For each of those crops, data must be submitted for those regions, which together, arranged  in descending order, represent at least 80  % of the area under a specific crop as compared with  the total area under that crop in the Member State concerned.\nSECTION V\nDeadlines, exchange of experience and transitional arrangements", "1.  The  calendar year in which the harvest begins shall hereinafter be referred to as the 'harvest year`.\n2.  For the land-use items given in Annex II, Member States shall supply the Commission with  provisional national data on the area under cultivation at the latest by 1 October of the harvest  year. Final data on those areas under cultivation shall be supplied at the latest by 1 April  following the harvest year.\n3.  Initial estimates of national yields and production figures on the products specified in Annex  VII shall be forwarded at the latest by the deadlines in that Annex. Provisional yields and  production figures on the products specified in Annex III shall be supplied at the latest by 15  April and final figures at the latest by 1 October, both in the year following the harvest year.\n4.  If yield and production figures refer to revised area data, the latter should also be  submitted.\n5.  The regional data referred to in Article 6 shall be supplied at the same time as the final  figures at national level and be consistent with them.", "1.  Within 12 months of the entry into force of this Regulation, Member States shall  submit a detailed methodological report to the Commission describing how data for the utilized  area, the arable land and the area under individual crops are obtained. Member States shall also  explain how yield and production are calculated in their respective countries and, where  appropriate, regions and indicate the representativeness and reliabilty of those figures. The  Commission, in collaboration with Member States, shall compile a summary of the reports.\n2.
