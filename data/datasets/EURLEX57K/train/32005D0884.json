Therefore, the basis for the Community\u2019s consent to be bound by such Conventions no longer exists. From this moment, the participation of the Community is no longer necessary or justified.\n(3) Moreover, the enlargement of the European Union has had the effect of radically transforming the legal relations between the Contracting Parties.
