However, the DDA negotiations have not yet been concluded.\n(4) The Philippines notified the Committee on Agriculture of the WTO on 22 November 2011 of its intention to enter into negotiations with WTO Members that have substantial interest in the products concerned for the continuation of its special treatment for rice.\n(5) Article IX paragraphs 3 and 4 of the WTO Agreement sets out the procedures for the granting of waivers concerning Multilateral Trade Agreements.\n(6) On that basis on 20 March 2012, the Philippines requested a WTO waiver from its obligations under Article 4.2 and Section B of Annex 5 of the AoA in order to receive special treatment for rice from 1 July 2012 until 30 June 2017.\n(7) The Union is a net importer of rice.
