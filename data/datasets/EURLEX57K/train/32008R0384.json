It also establishes the conditions for exemptions from the exit ban applicable to movements of susceptible animals, their semen, ova and embryos provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC.\n(2) In the light of new scientific information recently gathered on bluetongue virus pathogenesis related to the possible trans-placental transmission of bluetongue, some precautionary measures should be taken to prevent the possible spread of the disease by pregnant animals or certain newborn animals.\n(3) Animals that were immune before artificial insemination or mating, due to vaccination with an inactivated vaccine or due to natural immunity, or that have been protected against vectors' attacks for a certain period and subjected to certain laboratory tests with negative results are not considered to pose any significant risk as regards bluetongue. It should therefore be possible to exempt only such safe pregnant animals from the exit ban.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly. The provisions of this Regulation should, however, be reviewed in the near future in the light of additional knowledge that becomes available.\n(5) Where exemptions from the exit ban applicable to movements of animals of susceptible species from the restricted zones are applied to such animals intended for intra-Community trade or for export to a third country, health certificates provided for in Council Directive 64/432/EEC\u00a0(3), Council Directive 91/68/EEC\u00a0(4), Council Directive 92/65/EEC\u00a0(5) and referred to in Commission Decision 93/444/EEC\u00a0(6) are to include a reference to Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007. It is appropriate to provide for an additional wording to be added to all those health certificates in order to make more explicit the health conditions under which the pregnant animals are exempted from the exit ban.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, Section A is amended as follows:\n1. in point 1, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n2. the following paragraphs are added:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 April 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 74.
