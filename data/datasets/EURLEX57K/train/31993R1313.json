whereas the aid valid for the two marketing years in question should therefore be fixed during those months;\nWhereas in the absence of a guide price for cotton valid for the 1993/94 marketing year, the amount of aid to be granted where it is fixed in advance for that marketing year can be fixed only provisionally on the basis of the Commission's most recent  price proposals to the Council for the 1993/94 marketing year, taking account of the reduction provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 of 28 December 1992 amending the prices and amounts fixed in ecus as a result of the monetary  realignment of September and November 1992 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 784/93 (7); whereas this amount must therefore be applied provisionally only, and must be confirmed or replaced as soon as the price for the 1992/94 marketing year is  known;\nWhereas, pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 2 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87 of 2 July 1987 adjusting the system of aid for cotton (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2052/92 (9), the aid for cotton for the 1993/94  marketing year is reduced by ECU 5,140/100 kilograms as fixed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2511/92 (10) and by the reduction fixed to take account of the expected overrun of the maximum guaranteed quantity fixed by the second subparagraph of\nArticle 2\n(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87; whereas, in these circumstances, the amount of the aid has been provisionally calculated on the basis of an overall reduction of ECU 20,359/100 kilograms;\nWhereas the world market price for unginned cotton is determined periodically on the basis of the world prices recorded for ginned cotton and cotton seed, talking into account the estimated yield of the Community harvest in cotton seed and in ginned  cotton and also the net cost of ginning;\nWhereas the world market price for ginned cotton and cotton seed is determined in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81;\nWhereas, if the world market price for unginned cotton cannot be determined as described above, this price shall be established on the basis of the most recent price determined;\nWhereas the world market price for unginned cotton is equal to the sum of the values for ginned cotton seed defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89, minus the cost of beginning;\nWhereas the above values are established on the basis of the prices determined in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89; whereas the world market price is detrmined on the basis of the most favourable offers and quotations  recorded, excluding offers and quotations which cannot be regarded as representative of the real market trend;\nWhereas the necessary adjustments must be made in cases where the offers and quotations recorded do not satisfy the requirements indicated above;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 4 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81, if there are no suitable offers or quotations for determing the world market price for cotton seed, that price shall be established on the basis of the most favourable offers and  quotations for cotton seed recorded on the Community market or, if those offers and quotations cannot be established, on the basis of the value of the products obtained from processing the seed in the Community, less the processing cost; whereas this  value is determined in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89;\nWhereas the representative market rates defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 (11) are used to convert amounts expressed in third country currencies and are used as the basis for determining the agricultural conversion rates of the  Member States' currencies; whereas detailed rules on the application and determination of these conversions are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 (12);\nWhereas the aid must be fixed once a month, and in such a way that it can be applied for the first day of the month following the date of fixing; whereas it may be altered between fixings;\nWhereas it follows from applying these provisions to the offers and quotations known to the Commission that the aid for cotton should be as set out in this Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.
