In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) Article\u00a081(1) of the Treaty may in accordance with Article\u00a081(3) thereof be declared inapplicable to categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices which fulfil the conditions contained in Article\u00a081(3).\n(3) Pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the Treaty, the provisions for the application of Article\u00a081(3) of the Treaty should be adopted by way of Regulation\u00a0or Directive. According to Article\u00a083(2)(b), these provisions must lay down detailed rules for the application of Article\u00a081(3), taking into account the need to ensure effective supervision, on the one hand, and to simplify administration to the greatest possible extent on the other. According to Article\u00a083(2)(d), these provisions are required to define the respective functions of the Commission and of the Court of Justice.\n(4) Liner shipping is a capital intensive industry. Containerisation has increased pressures for cooperation and rationalisation. The Community shipping industry should attain the\u00a0necessary economies of scale in order to compete successfully on the world liner shipping market.\n(5) Joint-service agreements between liner shipping companies with the aim of rationalising their operations by means of technical, operational and/or commercial arrangements (described in shipping circles as consortia) can help to provide the necessary means for improving the productivity of liner shipping services and promoting technical and economic progress.\n(6) Maritime transport is important for the development of the Community\u2019s trade and the\u00a0consortia agreements may play a role in this respect, taking account of the special features of international liner shipping. The legalisation of these agreements is a measure which can make a positive contribution to improving the competitiveness of shipping in the\u00a0Community;\n(7) Users of the shipping services offered by consortia can obtain a share of the benefits resulting from the improvements in productivity and service, by means of, inter alia, regularity, cost reductions derived from higher levels of capacity utilisation, and better service quality stemming from improved vessels and equipment.\n(8) The Commission should be enabled to declare by way of Regulation that the provisions of Article\u00a081(1) of the Treaty do not apply to certain categories of consortia agreements, decisions and concerted practices, in order to make it easier for undertakings to cooperate in ways which are economically desirable and without adverse effect from the point of view of competition policy. The Commission, in close and constant liaison with the competent authorities of the Member States, should be able to define precisely the scope of these exemptions and the conditions attached to them.\n(9) Consortia in liner shipping are a specialised and complex type of joint venture. There is a\u00a0great variety of different consortia agreements operating in different circumstances. The\u00a0scope, parties, activities or terms of consortia are frequently altered. The Commission should therefore be given the responsibility of defining from time to time the consortia to which a group exemption should apply.\n(10) In order to ensure that all the conditions of Article\u00a081(3) of the Treaty are met, conditions should be attached to group exemptions to ensure in particular that a fair share of the\u00a0benefits will be passed on to shippers and that competition is not eliminated,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission may by Regulation and in accordance with Article\u00a081(3) of the Treaty, declare that Article\u00a081(1) of the Treaty shall not apply to certain categories of agreements between undertakings, decisions of associations of undertakings and concerted practices that have as an object to promote or establish cooperation in the joint operation of maritime transport services between liner shipping companies, for the purpose of rationalising their\u00a0operations by means of technical, operational or commercial arrangements with the\u00a0exception of price fixing (consortia).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such Regulation adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article shall define the categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices to which it applies and shall specify the\u00a0conditions and obligations under which, pursuant to Article\u00a081(3) of the Treaty, they shall be considered exempted from the application of Article\u00a081(1) of the Treaty.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Regulation adopted pursuant to Article 1 shall apply for a period of five years, calculated as from the date of its entry into force.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Regulation adopted pursuant to Article\u00a01 may be repealed or amended where circumstances have changed with respect to any of the facts which were basic to its\u00a0adoption.", "The Regulation adopted pursuant to Article 1 may include a provision stating that it applies with retroactive effect to agreements, decisions and concerted practices which were in existence at the\u00a0date of entry into force of such Regulation, provided they comply with the conditions established in that Regulation.", "The Regulation adopted pursuant to Article 1 may stipulate that the prohibition contained in Article\u00a081(1) of the Treaty shall not apply, for such a period as fixed by that Regulation, to agreements, decisions and concerted practices already in existence at 1\u00a0January\u00a01995, to which Article\u00a081(1) applies by virtue of the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and which do not satisfy the conditions of Article\u00a081(3).
