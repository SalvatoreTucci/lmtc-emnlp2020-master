Commission Decision 2005/778/EC\u00a0(2) confirmed that the dossier was \u2018complete\u2019 in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(2) For that active substance, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 12 December 2005.\n(3) The assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission in the format of the EFSA Scientific Report for fluopicolide on 4 June 2009\u00a0(3). This report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 27 November 2009 in the format of the Commission review report for fluopicolide.\n(4) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing fluopicolide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include fluopicolide in Annex\u00a0I to that Directive, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(5) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that the inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. It is appropriate, as regards fluopicolide, to require that the notifier submits further information on the relevance of the metabolite M15 for groundwater.\n(6) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing provisional authorisations of plant protection products containing fluopicolide to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should transform existing provisional authorisations into full authorisations, amend them or withdraw them in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 30 November 2010 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall in accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing fluopicolide as active substance by 30 November 2010. By that date, they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to that Directive relating to fluopicolide are met, with the exception of those identified in part B of the entry concerning the active substance, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive in accordance with the conditions of Article 13(2) of that Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for each authorised plant protection product containing fluopicolide as either the only active substance or as one of several active substances all of which were listed in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by 31 May 2010 at the latest, Member States shall re-evaluate the product in accordance with the uniform principles provided for in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III to that Directive and taking into account part B of the entry in Annex I to that Directive concerning fluopicolide. On the basis of that evaluation, they shall determine whether the product satisfies the conditions set out in Article 4(1)(b), (c), (d) and (e) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\nFollowing that determination Member States shall:\n(a) in the case of a product containing fluopicolide as the only active substance, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 30 November 2011 at the latest; or\n(b) in the case of a product containing fluopicolide as one of several active substances, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 30\u00a0November 2011 or by the date fixed for such an amendment or withdrawal in the respective Directive or Directives which added the relevant substance or substances to Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, whichever is the latest.", "This Directive shall enter into force on 1 June 2010.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 March 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0293, 9.11.2005, p.\u00a026.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Scientific Report (2009) 299, 1-158, Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluopicolide (finalised: 4 June 2009).\nANNEX\nIn Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the following entry is added at the end of the table:\nNo Common Name, Identification Numbers IUPAC Name Purity\u00a0(1) Entry into force Expiration of inclusion Specific provisions\n\u2018303 Fluopicolide 2,6-dichloro-N-[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridylmethyl]benzamide \u2265\u00a0970\u00a0g/kg 1 June 2010 31 May 2020 PART A\n\u2014 the protection of aquatic organisms,\n\u2014 the protection of groundwater when the active substance is applied in regions with vulnerable soil and/or climatic conditions,\n\u2014 to the risk to operators during application,\n\u2014 the potential for long range transport via air.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Further details on identity and specification of active substances are provided in the review report."}
