A temporary derogation should be made from the timetable for concluding contracts laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1535/2003. Otherwise, and particularly in the case of tomatoes, for which contracts must be concluded before 15 February, the parties concerned would be unable to benefit from the aid scheme during the first marketing year.\n(3) The mechanism for examining compliance with the national processing thresholds provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 does not apply immediately to the new Member States. Transitional measures for its application should therefore be laid down. For the first marketing year of application, for which there are no data for the calculation, the aid should be paid in full. However, as a precautionary measure, a prior reduction should be made to be reimbursed if there is no overrun at the end of the marketing year. For subsequent marketing years, provision should be made for the gradual application of the system for examining compliance with the threshold.\n(4) Since the aid for tomatoes is published in the January preceding the marketing year concerned, transitional measures should also be laid down for examining compliance with the threshold for the purposes of fixing the level of aid for the 2007/08 marketing year.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 6(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1535/2003, in the case of tomatoes in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (hereafter the new Member States) during the 2004/05 marketing year, contracts between recognised producer organisations within the meaning of paragraph 1(1)(a) of the said Regulation and approved processors shall be concluded by 15 July and at least 10 days before deliveries are to commence.", "For the 2004/05 marketing year and for the new Member States, the aid provided for in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 shall be:\n- EUR 25,88/tonne for tomatoes,\n- EUR 35,78/tonne for peaches,\n- EUR 121,28/tonne for pears.", "1.
