As a result, the transport and marketing of hatching eggs were temporarily banned within Italy or within the areas directly affected by the outbreak.\n(2) The restrictions on the free movement of hatching eggs resulting from the application of the veterinary measures threatened severe disruption of the market in hatching eggs in Italy. The Italian authorities adopted market support measures for the period for which this was absolutely necessary. These allowed hatching eggs falling within CN code 0407\u00a000\u00a019 for which incubation was no longer possible to be processed into egg products and the destruction of hatching eggs falling within CN codes 0407\u00a000\u00a019 and 0407\u00a000\u00a011.\n(3) These measures had a beneficial effect on the market in hatching eggs. This justifies their being treated as an exceptional market support measure within the meaning of Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 and the grant of aid to compensate for part of the financial loss resulting from the processing or destruction of hatching eggs.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use for processing of hatching eggs falling within CN code 0407\u00a000\u00a019 and the destruction of hatching eggs falling within CN codes 0407\u00a000\u00a019 and 0407\u00a000\u00a011, between 17 December 1999 and 14 April 2000, between 14 August and 16 October 2000 and between 11 October 2002 and 30 September 2003, decided on by the Italian authorities following the application of the national veterinary measures under, in particular, Directive 92/40/EEC, are hereby deemed to be an exceptional market support measure within the meaning of Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the measure referred to in paragraph 1, compensation of:\n\u2014 EUR\u00a00,0942 per hatching egg falling within CN code 0407\u00a000\u00a019 processed shall be granted for a maximum total number of 770\u00a0751 eggs,\n\u2014 EUR\u00a00,1642 per hatching egg falling within CN code 0407\u00a000\u00a019 destroyed shall be granted for a maximum total number of 165\u00a0040 eggs, and\n\u2014 EUR\u00a00,5992 per hatching egg falling within CN code 0407\u00a000\u00a011 shall be granted for a maximum total number of 264\u00a0930 eggs.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 49.
