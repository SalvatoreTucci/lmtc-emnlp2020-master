Annex V shall apply without prejudice to Directive 75/442/EEC, as amended by Directive 91/156/EEC, and Directive 91/689/EEC.\n2. This Annex consists of three parts, whereby Parts 2 and 3 only apply when Part 1 is not applicable. Consequently, to determine if a specific waste is covered by Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 259/93, one has to first check whether the waste features in Part 1 of Annex V, if this is not the case whether it features in Part 2, and if this is not the case whether it features in Part 3.\nPart 1 is divided into two sub-sections: List A enumerating wastes which are classified as hazadous for the purposes of the Basel Convention and therefore are covered by the export ban and List B enumerating wastes which are not covered by the export ban.\nThus, if a waste features in Part 1, one has to check if it is enumerated in List A or in List B. Only if a waste does not feature in either List A or List B of Part 1, one has to check if it features in Part 2 or 3 and if this is the case it is covered by the export ban.\n3. Member States may make provisions, in exceptional cases, to determine, om the basis of documentary evidence provided in an appropriate way by the holder, that a specific waste on this Annex is excluded from the export ban referred to in Article 16(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 as amended, if it does not display any of the properties listed in Annex III to Directive 91/689/EEC, taking into account, as regards H3 to H8 of the said Annex, the limit values laid down in Council Decision 94/904/EC(1).\nIn such a case, the Member State concerned shall inform the envisaged importing country prior to taking a decision. Member States shall notify such cases to the Commission before the end of each calendar year. The Commission shall forward the information to all Member States and to the Secretariat of the Basel Convention. On the basis of the information provided, the Commission may make comments and, where appropriate, submit proposals to the Committee established pursuant to Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC with a view to adapting Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 259/93.\n4. The fact a waste is not listed in this Annex, or that it is listed in Part 1, List B, does not preclude, in exceptional cases, characterisation of such a waste as hazardous and therefore subject to the export ban referred to in Article 16(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 as amended, if it displays any of the properties listed in Annex III to Directive 91/689/EEC, taking into account, as regards H3 to H8 of the said Annex, the limit values laid down in Decision 94/904/EC, as provided for in Article 1(4), second indent, of Directive 91/689/EEC and in the Header of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 259/93.\nIn such a case, the Member State concerned shall inform the envisaged importing country prior to taking a decision. Member States shall notifiy such cases to the Commission before the end of each calendar year. The Commission shall forward the information to all Member States and to the Secretariat of the Basel Convention. On the basis of the information provided, the Commission may make comments and, where appropriate, submit proposals to the Committee established pursuant to Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC with a view to adapting Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 259/93;\nPART 1\n>TABLE>\nPART 2\nWastes listed in Decision 94/904/EC establishing a list of hazardous waste pursuant to Article 1(4) of Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste\n>TABLE>\nPART 3\nWaste from Annexes III and IV to Regulation (EEC) No 259/93.
