These rules should be supplemented with implementing rules and the Regulations which previously dealt with that matter, Commission Regulations (EEC) No 1698/70(2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 986/89(3), (EEC) No 2236/73(4), (EEC) No 2082/74(5), as last amended by the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Hellenic Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties(6) and (EEC) No 2903/79(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86(8), should be repealed.\n(2) These rules were previously dispersed throughout a number of Community Regulations. It would be in the interests of economic operators in the Community and of the authorities responsible for applying Community rules to collate all these provisions in a single Regulation.\n(3) That Regulation should include the current rules adapted to the new requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. It should also be simpler and more consistent, and provide complete coverage of the subject, which means that certain gaps must be filled in. In addition, some rules should be more specifically worded, to ensure greater legal certainty when they are applied.\n(4) It should be specified that this Regulation applies without prejudice to any special provisions laid down in other areas.\n(5) Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for a number of lists of quality wines psr. Those lists must be established.\n(6) Paragraph 3 of Annex VI of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 requires the producer Member States to carry out systematic organoleptic tests for each quality wine psr produced on their territory.\n(7) The task of comparing the results of tests with the specifications prescribed and of carrying out organoleptic tests should be entrusted to inspection boards.\n(8) There should be provision regarding the use to be made of wines suitable for yielding quality wines psr that are not accepted as quality wines psr by the board concerned.\n(9) The Commission should be informed of the measures taken by the Member States and of the manner in which they are applied.\n(10) Pursuant to Article 56(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, a quality wine psr may be downgraded at the marketing stage in certain circumstances only. These circumstances should be specified and the use to which quality wines psr so downgraded may be put should be stated, as should the conditions for those uses. The competent authorities having the right to downgrade wines should be indicated.\n(11) To avoid distorting competition, a downgraded quality wine psr must not be marketed under a designation similar to the designation which can no longer be allocated to it. For monitoring to operate smoothly, entries in stock movement registers must record the downgrading.\n(12) For the Commission to be able to monitor the application by the competent authorities in the Member States of the provisions governing the downgrading of quality wines psr, the Member States should notify the Commission each year of the quantities of quality wine psr downgraded on their territory.\n(13) The downgrading of a quality wine psr on the territory of a Member State other than that in which it originated should be carried out by a competent body of the Member State of origin. To that end, direct cooperation should be ensured between the bodies responsible in the Member States for the supervision of the production and marketing of quality wines psr and rules for such cooperation should be laid down. However, in order to simplify the administrative task of the Member States, it should be possible for the competent body of the Member State which has on its territory a small quantity of the quality wine psr in question to downgrade this quantity itself.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Purpose\nThis Regulation lays down detailed rules for implementing the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 relating to quality wine produced in specified regions (quality wine psr).\nTITLE I\nRULES RELATING TO SPECIFIED REGIONS", "Demarcation of areas in immediate proximity to a specified region\nNotwithstanding the rule in point 1(b) of paragraph D of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, but pursuant to point 3 of paragraph D of Annex VI to that Regulation, the area in immediate proximity to a specified region where a quality wine psr may be obtained or manufactured shall be demarcated by each Member State concerned and for each quality wine psr concerned.

The Member States shall lay down rules to ensure that analytical and organoleptic tests are carried out systematically for all quality wines psr produced on their territory. However, for wines from the 2000/2001 wine year, the tests may be carried out by sampling.\nThey shall ensure that each sample taken is representative of each of the quality wines psr held by the producer.\n3. For all wines liable to become quality wines psr, the tests referred to in paragraph 2 shall be carried out at the production stage before the wine is classified as a quality wine psr.\n4. Wine may be classified as a quality wine psr only where:\n(a) the results of the analytical tests carries out in accordance with the methods referred to in Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 prove that the wine falls within the required limits referred to in point 1(a) of paragraph J of Annex VI to that Regulation, and\n(b) the organoleptic test shows that the wine possesses all the appropriate features.", "Use of wine that does not pass the analytical and organoleptic tests\nWhere the analytical and organoleptic tests show that the wine is not suitable to be classified as the quality wine psr claimed, then the wine may, if it has the required characteristics, be classified:\n(a) as another quality wine psr, if the conditions for its classification as such are met, or\n(b) as table wine, provided that enrichment, if any, has been carried out in accordance with Article 43(2) of and paragraphs C and G of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, or\n(c) as wine of another category, as referred to in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.\nTITLE IV\nRULES APPLICABLE TO DOWNGRADING", "0\nConditions for certain cases of downgrading quality wines psr at the marketing stage\n1.

For the purposes of applying Article 56(3) of that Regulation, a quality wine psr shall be deemed to have undergone a change such as to justify downgrading in particular when it is found that:\n(a) it no longer meets the requirements for at least one of the features referred to in point 1(a) of paragraph J of Annex VI to the Regulation, or\n(b) it no longer has at least one of the characteristics of quality wine psr from the region whose name it bears.\n3.

The Commission shall take all appropriate steps to publish the notifications in all Member States.\n6. Where necessary, any competent body may declare that the accompanying document issued for a downgraded wine is in breach of the rules.\nStock movement registers kept by the holder of a downgraded wine shall specify that the wine has been downgraded from a quality wine psr.", "1\nNotification by Member States of the downgrading of quality wines psr\nFor each wine marketing year, the Member States shall collect data on quantities of quality wine psr downgraded on their territory.\nThey shall notify these data to the Commission no later than 1 November following the wine year in which downgrading is declared.\nThe data shall distinguish between wine downgraded from quality wine psr\n(a) at the production stage:\n(i) on the initiative of the competent body, or\n(ii) at the request of the producer;\n(b) at the marketing stage:\n(i) on the initiative of the competent body, or\n(ii) at the request of the trader.\nThey shall indicate the quantities broken down by product category resulting from the downgrading.", "2\nDirect collaboration of the Member States' competent bodies as regards the downgrading of quality wine psr\n1.
