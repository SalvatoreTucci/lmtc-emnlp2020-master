These changes have to be taken into account in the farm return, in order to be able to monitor correctly the development of agricultural incomes and provide sufficient basis for business analyses of the holdings.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008 of 8 December 2008 establishing a Community typology for agricultural holdings\u00a0(4) introduced a classification variable reflecting the importance of the other gainful activities (OGA) directly related to the holding.

In order to be consistent with the farm structure survey the recording of Christmas trees in the farm return should be adjusted.\n(5) In its current form it is not foreseen in the farm return to indicate that the majority of the utilised agricultural area of a holding is not situated in a structural funds area. To further clarify the instructions, an option to indicate that farms are not located in an area referred to in Articles 5, 6 or 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01083/2006 of 11\u00a0July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999\u00a0(6) should be added.\n(6) In its current form it is not foreseen in the farm return to record mushrooms as being grown under shelter. As mushrooms are frequently grown in caves or in buildings, it should be possible to indicate in the farm return that mushrooms are grown under shelter.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 868/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee of the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Regulation (EC) No 868/2008 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the 2010 accounting year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 August 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 109, 23.6.1965, p. 1859/65.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 237, 4.9.2008, p. 18.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 31.1.2009, p. 16.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 335, 13.12.2008, p. 3.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 321, 1.12.2008, p. 14.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 25.\nANNEX\nThe Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 868/2008 are amended as follows:\n1.
