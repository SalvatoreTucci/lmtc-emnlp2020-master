Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC\u00a0(2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC.\n(3) On 10 August 2007, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from A2704-12 soybean as described in the application (\u2018the products\u2019) will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of their intended uses\u00a0(3). In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.\n(4) In particular, EFSA concluded that after considering all the data available in the application on the molecular characterisation, compositional analysis and agronomic performance, A2704-12 soybean is equivalent to its non-genetically modified counterpart and, as a consequence, that no further animal safety studies with the whole food/feed (e.g. a 90-day toxicity study in rats) are needed.\n(5) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.\n(6) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.\n(7) A unique identifier should be assigned to each genetically modified organism (GMO) as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms\u00a0(4).\n(8) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary for the foods, food ingredients and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from A2704-12 soybean. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and other products than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.\n(9) Similarly, the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n(10) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n(11) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC\u00a0(5), lays down labelling requirements for products consisting or containing GMOs.\n(12) This decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Articles 9(1) and 15(2)(c), of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms\u00a0(6).\n(13) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman; the Commission has therefore submitted a proposal to the Council on 28 April 2008 in accordance with Article 5 of the Council Decision 1999/468/EC\u00a0(7), the Council being required to act within three months.\n(14) However, the Council has not acted within the required time limit; a Decision should now be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Genetically modified organism and unique
