Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of that Regulation, or to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(4) When, on imperative grounds of urgency regarding the maintenance of a sufficient level of aviation safety, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to use the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision\u00a01999/468/EC for the adoption of certain measures.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 3922/1991 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 is hereby amended as follows:\n1) Article 8 shall be amended as follows:\n(a) The fourth subparagraph of paragraph 3 shall be replaced by the following:\n(b) The fourth subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall be replaced by the following:\n2) Article 11 shall be amended as follows:\n(a) Paragraph\u00a01 shall be replaced by the following:\n(b) In paragraph 2, the words \u2018in Article 12\u2019 shall be replaced by \u2018in Article 12(3)\u2019;\n3) Article 12 shall be replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 2006\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
