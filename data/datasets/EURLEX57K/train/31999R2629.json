whereas this consideration and the desirability of efficient quota administration make it appropriate for operators to be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2000 equivalent to the quantity (for each textile category and each third country) which they imported in 1999;\n(7) Whereas for optimum use of the quantities it is appropriate to envisage that each operator, after 50 % utilisation of a licence, can introduce a new request for a licence, not exceeding a predetermined quantity, provided quantities are available in the quotas;\n(8) Whereas it is appropriate for the sake of sound administration to make import authorisations valid for nine months from the date of issue and to stipulate that the Member States can issue licences only after being notified of the Commission's decision and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and certify (except where specifically provided otherwise) that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned; whereas the competent national authorities are however authorised, in response to importers' applications, to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2001 licences of which at least 50 % has been used by the application date;\n(9) Whereas in order to obviate any potential problems caused by the possible impact of a millenium bug on computer systems the import authorisations shall start to be allocated in December 1999;\n(10) Whereas the measures contained in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion expressed by the Committee established by Regulation (EC) No 517/94,", "main_body": ["This Regulation specifies certain rules concerning the management of quantitative quotas established by Regulation (EC) No 517/94 and applicable for 2000.", "The quotas referred to in Article 1 and shown in Annexes IIIB and IV to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 shall be allocated on a \"first come, first served\" basis according to the chronological order of receipt by the Commission of Member States' notifications of applications from individual operators, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities per operator stipulated in the Annex hereto.\nThese maximum quantities shall not, however, apply to operators able to prove to the competent national authorities when making their first application for 2000 that they imported, for given categories, given third countries and under import licences granted to them for 1999, more than the maximum quantities specified for each category. In the case of such operators, the competent authorities may authorise imports of no more than the quantities imported in 1999 for given third countries and given categories, provided that enough quota is available.", "Any importer who has used 50 % or more of the amount allocated to him through a licence under this Regulation may make a further application for a licence, for the same category and country of origin, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities laid down in the Annex hereto, provided that enough of the quota is available.", "The requests for import authorisations can be submitted to the Commission as of 20 December 1999 at 10 a.m., Brussels time. Import authorisations shall be valid for nine months from the date of issue, but not earlier than 1 January 2000, and in no case later than 31 December 2000. On licences issued before 1 January 2000, the competent authorities of the Member States will indicate in box 13 (further particulars): \"This license is valid from 1 January 2000.\"\nAt the importer's request, the competent national authorities may, however, grant a three-month extension for licences which are at least 50 % used up at the time of the request. The extension must in no case last beyond 31 March 2001.\nThe competent authorities of the Member States shall issue authorisations only after being notified of the Commission's decision and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 3, certify in writing that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2000.", "shall apply as from 20 December 1999.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 1999.\nFor the Commission\nPascal LAMY\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 67, 10.3.1994, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 307, 2.12.1999, p. 14.\n(3) OJ L 335, 10.12.1998, p. 43.\nANNEX\nMaximum amounts referred to in Article 2\n>TABLE>"}
