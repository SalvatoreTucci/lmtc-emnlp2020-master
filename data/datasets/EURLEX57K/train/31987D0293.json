Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus termed \"Fat-O-Meater (FOM)\".\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 6 millimetres diameter containing a photodiode of the Siemens SFH 950/960 type and having an operating distance of between 5 and 105 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. \u0177 = 64,77 \u2212 1,4444x\n+ 0,0200x\n+ 0,1153x\n2,\nwhere\n\u0177 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured 6 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase between the third and fourth last ribs,\nx2 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x1.\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 40 and 100 kilograms.\nPART 2\nHennessy Grading Probe (HGP2)\n1. Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus termed \"Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP2)\".\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 millimetres at the blade on top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO and photodetector of the type 58 MR) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be transformed in terms of estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP 2 itself as well as a computer linked to it.\n3. \u0177 = 65,54 \u2212 1,3498x\n+ 0,0177x\n+ 0,0719x\n2,\nwhere\n\u0177 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,\nx2 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x1.\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 40 and 100 kilograms.\nPART 3\nIntroscope/midline\n1. Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the method termed \"Introscope/midline\".\n2. The Introscope shall be equipped with a hexagonal shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 millimetres (and of 19 millimetres at the blade on top of the probe) containing a viewing window and light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres and having an operating distance of between 8 and 50 millimetres.\n3. \u0177 = 68,47 \u2212 1,1616x\n+ 0,0186x\n\u2212 0,1796x\n2,\nwhere\n\u0177 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,\nx2 = the minimum thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres measured on the midline of the split carcase covering the lumbar muscle (M. glutaeus medius).\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 40 and 100 kilograms.\n--------------------------------------------------"}
