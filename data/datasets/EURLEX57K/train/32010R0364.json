The cooperating non-sampled companies which were granted market economy treatment (MET), in accordance with the provisions of Article\u00a02(7)(c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96\u00a0(3), were attributed the weighted average duty of 14,1\u00a0% which was established for the sampled companies which were granted MET. The cooperating non-sampled companies which were granted individual treatment (IT), in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(5) of the same Regulation, received the weighted average duty of 37,1\u00a0% established for the sampled companies that were granted IT. A countrywide duty of 56,2\u00a0% was imposed on all other companies.\n(4) Following an anti-absorption reinvestigation pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation\u00a0(EC)\u00a0No\u00a0384/96, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1087/2007\u00a0(4) increased the countrywide duty to 74,8\u00a0%. In addition, Chinese exporting producers with individual duty rates that did not cooperate in the reinvestigation were attributed higher anti-dumping duties in accordance with the provisions of Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96.\n(5) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 gives the possibility to Chinese exporting producers which meet the four criteria set out in that Article to be granted the same treatment as the one set out in recital 3 for the cooperating companies not included in the sample (\u2018New Exporting Producer Treatment\u2019 or \u2018NEPT\u2019).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NEW EXPORTING PRODUCERS\u2019 REQUEST\n(6) One group of companies consisting of two related companies, namely AlbaChiara Printing and Dyeing (Jiaxing) Co. Ltd, and Jiaxing E. Boselli Textile Trading Co. Ltd (\u2018the\u00a0applicant\u2019), requested to be granted NEPT.\n(7) An examination has been carried out to determine whether the applicant fulfils the criteria for being granted NEPT as set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01487/2005, by verifying that:\n(a) it did not export the product concerned to the European Union during the investigation period on which the measures are based (1\u00a0April\u00a02003 to\u00a031\u00a0March\u00a02004) (\u2018the first criterion\u2019),\n(b) it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People\u2019s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation (\u2018the\u00a0second criterion\u2019),\n(c) it has actually exported to the European Union the product concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity of the product concerned to the European Union (\u2018the third criterion\u2019),\n(d) it operates under market economy conditions defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or, alternatively, that it fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation (\u2018the fourth criterion\u2019).\n(8) Questionnaires were sent to the applicant asking it to supply evidence to demonstrate that it met the first, second and third criteria.\n(9) Since the fourth criterion implies that the applicants submit a claim for MET and/or IT, the Commission sent MET and IT claim forms to the applicant. The applicant requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation.\n(10) Briefly, and for ease of reference only, the MET criteria are set out in summarised form\u00a0below:\n(a) business decisions and costs are made in response to market signals and without significant State interference; and costs of major inputs substantially reflect market\u00a0values;\n(b) firms have one clear set of basic accounting records which are independently audited in line with international accounting standards\u00a0(5) and are applied for all\u00a0purposes;\n(c) there are no significant distortions carried over from the former non-market economy\u00a0system;\n(d) bankruptcy and property laws guarantee legal certainty and stability;\n(e) exchange rate conversions are carried out at market rates.\n(11) Exporting producers fulfilling the criteria mentioned in recital 7 may, pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005, be granted either the 14,1\u00a0% duty rate applicable to companies to which MET was granted in accordance with Article\u00a02(7)(c) of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 384/96, or the weighted average duty rate of\u00a037,1\u00a0% applicable to companies to which IT was granted in accordance with Article 9(5) of the same\u00a0Regulation.\n(12) The European Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of determining whether the four criteria set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01487/2005 had been fulfilled. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies:\n\u2014 AlbaChiara Printing and Dyeing (Jiaxing) Co. Ltd, Jiaxing,\n\u2014 Jiaxing E. Boselli Textile Trading Co. Ltd, Jiaxing.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FINDINGS\n(13) The applicant has provided sufficient evidence to prove that it meets the four criteria mentioned in recital 7. The applicant in fact could prove that (i) it did not export the product concerned to the European Union during the period 1 April 2003 to\u00a031\u00a0March 2004, (ii) it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People\u2019s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005, (iii) it actually exported a significant quantity of the product concerned to the European Union starting from the year 2008, (iv) it fulfils all the requirements for MET and can therefore be granted an individual duty in accordance with Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, the applicant could be granted the weighted average duty rate applicable to cooperating companies not included in the sample which have been granted MET (i.e.\u00a014,1\u00a0%) in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005, and should be added to the list of exporting producers in Article 1(2) of that Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MODIFICATION OF THE LIST OF COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM INDIVIDUAL DUTY RATES\n(14) In consideration of the findings of the investigation as indicated in recital 13, it is concluded that the companies AlbaChiara Printing and Dyeing (Jiaxing) Co. Ltd, and Jiaxing E. Boselli Textile Trading Co. Ltd should be added to the list of individual companies mentioned under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 with a duty rate of 14,1\u00a0%.\n(15) The applicant and the Union industry have been informed of the findings of the investigation and have had the opportunity to submit their comments.
