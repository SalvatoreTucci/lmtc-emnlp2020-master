It submitted its assessment, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report, to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, on 9 March 2010.\n(5) The Commission consulted the Authority which presented its opinion on the risk assessment of glufosinate on 8 March 2012\u00a0(5). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the opinion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 15 March 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for glufosinate.\n(6) In the light of the additional information provided by the notifier, the Commission considered that the further confirmatory information required had not been provided and that a high risk for mammals and non-target arthropods could not be excluded except by imposing further restrictions.\n(7) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the review report for glufosinate.\n(8) It is confirmed that the active substance glufosinate is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. In order to minimise the exposure of mammals and non-target arthropods, it is, however, appropriate to further restrict the uses of this active substance and to provide for specific risk mitigation measures for the protection of those species.\n(9) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) Member States should be provided with time to withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing glufosinate.\n(11) For plant protection products containing glufosinate, where Member States grant any period of grace in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest one year after the withdrawal of the authorisations.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nThe Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Transitional measures\nMember States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing glufosinate as active substance by 13 November 2013.", "Period of grace\nAny period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 shall be as short as possible and shall expire 12 months after withdrawal of the respective authorisation at the latest.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 April 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 106, 24.4.2007, p. 34.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0European Food Safety Authority; Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of confirmatory data submitted for the active substance glufosinate.

In this overall assessment Member States shall pay particular attention to:\n(a) the operator, worker and bystander safety; conditions of authorisation shall include protective measures, where appropriate;\n(b) the potential for groundwater contamination, where the active substance is applied in regions with vulnerable soil or climatic conditions;\n(c) the protection of mammals, non-target arthropods and non-target plants.\nConditions of authorisation shall include the application of drift reducing nozzles and spray shields and shall provide for respective labelling of plant protection products. Those conditions shall include further risk mitigation measures, where appropriate.\u2019."}
