Area covered\nThe entire Spanish coastline, except the Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla.\n3. Duration\nThe programme covers the period 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1993.\n4. Objectives and investment forecasts\nThe objectives of this programme are the modernization and fitting out of Spanish fishing ports in order to improve the ways in which fisheries products are produced, landed and offered for sale.\nThe total investment amount required during the programme to attain the objectives is Ptas 21 143 300 000 or ECU 158 780 000 (1), split as follows:\n1.2.3 //  //  //  //  // (million Ptas)   // (million ecus)  //    //   //   // (A) All investments covered by Regulation (EEC) No 355/77   // 4 369,6   // 32,82   // (B.1) The supplies   // 2 806,0   // 21,07   // (B.2) Cold storage plant   // 2 611,7   // 19,61   // (B.3) Water supplies   // 554,0   // 4,16   // (B.4) Fishing-landing equipment   // 1 109,0   // 8,32  // (B.5) Fuel supplies   // 327,5   // 2,45   // (B.6) The improvement of back-up facilities   // 7 720,0   // 57,97  // (B.7) Alterations to or the provisions of facilities at quays in order to improve safety conditions during embarkation and landing of products   // 1 645,5   // 12,35   //    //  //   // TOTAL  // 21 143,3   // 158,78   //    //   //\n(a) The financial estimates as well as the apportionment between the different types of investment are indicative only.\n(b) The Commission recalls that among the investments are included:\n- installations for primary processing of fischeries products (ECU 33 million) covered by Regulation (EEC) No 355/77 which must be financed as a priority conforming that Regulation,\n- installations for cold storage (ECU 20 million) which in certains cases are eligible under Regulation (EEC) No 355/77 and which must equally be financed as a priority in conformity with this Regulation,\n- measures to improve back-up facilities for fishing vessels ECU 57 970 000 and the alterations to or the provisions of facilities at quays in order to improve safety conditions during embarkation and landings of products (ECU 12 350 000, which include certain investments, which although forming part of a mesure to develop port installations, are not listed as elegible in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2321/88 (2),\nThus, once projects are submitted for aid under this Regulation, it is for the Commission to study them and decide on whether or not they are eligible.\n5. National aids\nThe national aid envisaged is 10 % of the total amount of the investment.\nThe above investments will qualify for subsidies from the State and from the market organization on regulation fund (FROM) and for subsidized loans and grants from the 'Comunidades Autonomas'.\nANNEX II\nREMARKS\nThe Commission finds that the programme presented by the Spanish Government as a framework for future Community and national financial assistance is an adequate basis for promoting development of facilities at fishing ports and of the processing and marketing of fishery products.\nThe Commission must point out that development of facilities at ports and of processing and marketing must be geared to the probable trend of resource volumes and to the results and objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleet and for aquaculture.\nThe Commission must also point to the necessity of compliance, in projects and programmes financed through the structural funds and Community financial instruments, of compliance with Community rules on public contracts (1).\n(1) ECU 1 = Ptas 131,161 (2. 1. 1989).\n(2) OJ No L 202, 27. 7. 1988, p. 18.\n(1) Directive 71/305/EEC of 26 July 1971 (OJ No. L 185, 16. 8. 1971), as last amended by Directive 78/669/EEC (OJ No L 225, 16. 8. 1978, p. 71)."}
