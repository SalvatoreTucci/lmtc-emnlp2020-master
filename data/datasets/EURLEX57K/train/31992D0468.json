whereas these derogations are subject to approval, under certain conditions, in accordance with Article 14 (2) and must also comply with the conditions laid down in Annex IV, part A (24);\nWhereas in Greece, Italy and Portugal the growing of potatoes of certain North American varieties has been an established practice; whereas part of the supply of seed potatoes of these varieties has been ensured by imports from Canada;\nWhereas, by Decisions 86/120/EEC (3), 87/154/EEC (4), as amended by Decision 87/311/EEC (5), 88/176/EEC (6), as amended by Decision 88/496/EEC (7), 89/32/EEC (8), and 89/599/EEC (9), as amended by Decision 91/592/EEC (10), the Commission approved  derogations based on the concept of 'areal freedom', subject to certain technical conditions to prevent the risk of harmful organisms spreading; whereas that approval expired on 31 March 1992; whereas the Commission also provided that those derogations  would provide for the opportunity to seek confirmation of the proper functioning of the concept of 'areal freedom';\nWhereas Greece, Italy and Portugal have stated that they intend to provide for derogations for the next seed-potato marketing season;\nWhereas it is known that Canada is still not free from potato spindle tuber viroid or from Corynebacterium sepedonicum;\nWhereas Canada has further developed its programme to eradicate these harmful organisms in the provinces of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island; whereas there are good reasons to believe that the programme to eradicate potato spindle tuber viroid has  become fully effective in those provinces, and that the programme to eradicate Corynebacterium sepedonicum has become fully effective in certain areas of these provinces; whereas there have been no findings of the disease on samples drawn from seed  potatoes imported pursuant to Decision 91/592/EEC; whereas it has not been established that there are sufficient elements which would militate against the proper functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'areal freedom' and therefore against the  recognition of the provisions implemented there as equivalent to the Community provisions on combating Corynebacterium sepedonicum;\nWhereas it can therefore be established that there is no risk of the harmful organisms in question spreading, provided that the seed potatoes originate in areas declared, on scientific evidence, free from both potato spindle tuber viroid and from  Corynebacterium sepedonicum, and that certain improved special technical conditions are complied with; whereas the Commission will ensure that Canada makes all technical information available which is necessary to monitor the functioning of the  protective measures required under the aforementioned technical conditions and to assess the functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'areal freedom';\nWhereas, therefore, the derogations provided for by Greece, Italy and Portugal should be approved for the next seed-potato marketing season, provided that they include the aforementioned conditions and without prejudice to Council Directive 66/403/EEC  (11), as last amended by Directive 92/17/EEC (12), and to Council Directive 70/457/EEC (13), as last amended by Directive 90/654/EEC (14);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 89/599/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
