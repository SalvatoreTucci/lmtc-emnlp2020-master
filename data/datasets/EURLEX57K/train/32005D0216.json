That Decision demarcates protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) corresponding to specific epidemiological situations and lays down the conditions for providing for exemptions from the exit ban provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC for certain movements of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos from and through those zones.\n(2) Winter conditions in parts of the regions of the Community affected by bluetongue have resulted in a cessation of the vector\u2019s activity and as a consequence of the circulation of the bluetongue virus.\n(3) Accordingly, it is appropriate to establish rules providing for exemptions from the exit ban for animals in the concerned parts of the restricted zones during periods where there is a proven absence of viral circulation or of vectors.\n(4) When since the cessation of the vector\u2019s activity a period has elapsed which is longer than the seroconversion period, seronegative animals can be moved with an acceptable level of risk from the restricted zones as they cannot be or become infected. Animals which are seropositive but virologically negative (PCR negative) may also be moved as they are not and cannot become viremic.\n(5) Animals born after the cessation of the vector\u2019s activity cannot be infected and as a consequence can be moved with no risk from the restricted zone in the absence of the vector\u2019s activity.\n(6) As the traceability of the movements of those animals must be subject to strict controls, those movements should be limited to domestic movements to holdings registered by the competent authority of the holding of destination.\n(7) In addition, any such movements must cease when the vector\u2019s activity re-starts in an epidemiological relevant area of the restricted zones concerned.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Article 3 of Decision 2003/828/EC is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(b) the following paragraph 3a is inserted after paragraph 3:\n(a) animals which are destined for holdings registered for this purpose by the competent authority of the holding of destination and which may only be moved from such holdings to a slaughterhouse;\n(b) animals which are serologically (ELISA or AGID) negative or serologically positive but virologically (PCR) negative; or\n(c) animals born after the date of cessation of the vector\u2019s activity.", "This Decision shall apply from 19 March 2005.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 March 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 74.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 311, 27.11.2003, p. 41.
