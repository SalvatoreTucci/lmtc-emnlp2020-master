The Union approved the Kyoto Protocol by Council Decision 2002/358/EC\u00a0(1). The Union and its Member States ratified the Kyoto Protocol and agreed to fulfil their commitments under the first commitment period jointly. Iceland ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 23 May 2002.\n(2) The Council, at its meeting on 15 December 2009, welcomed a request by Iceland to fulfil its commitments under a second commitment period jointly with the Union and its Member States and invited the Commission to present a recommendation for the opening of the necessary negotiations on an agreement with Iceland that is in line with the principles and criteria set out in the Union's Climate and Energy Package.\n(3) At the Doha Climate Conference in December 2012, all parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed on the Doha Amendment which establishes a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020. The Doha Amendment amends Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol, sets out further legally-binding mitigation commitments for parties listed in that Annex for the second commitment period, amends and further elaborates on provisions concerning the implementation of parties' commitments during the second commitment period.\n(4) The targets for the Union, its Member States and Iceland are inscribed in the Doha Amendment with a footnote stating that those targets are based on the understanding that they will be fulfilled jointly, in accordance with Article 4 of the Kyoto Protocol. The Union, its Member States and Iceland also issued a joint statement upon the adoption of the Doha Amendment on 8 December 2012, expressing their intention to fulfil their commitments for the second commitment period jointly. The statement was agreed during an ad hoc meeting of EU Ministers in Doha and endorsed by the Council on 17 December 2012.\n(5) In that statement the Union, its Member States and Iceland stated, in line with Article 4(1) of the Kyoto Protocol, which allows parties to fulfil their commitments under Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol jointly, that Article 3(7ter) of the Kyoto Protocol will be applied to the joint assigned amount pursuant to the agreement on joint fulfilment by the Union, its Member States, Croatia and Iceland and that it will not be applied to Member States, Croatia or Iceland individually.\n(6) Article 4(1) of the Kyoto Protocol requires parties that agree to fulfil their commitments under Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol jointly to set out in the Agreement the respective emission level allocated to each of the parties to that Agreement.
