For the sake of clarity, the Commission should publish the ceiling resulting from the amounts notified by the Member States for the measures concerned.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 69(6)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, the amounts calculated in accordance with Article 69(7) of that Regulation have been laid down in Annex III of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1120/2009 of 29 October 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\u00a0(2).

The amount to be deducted from the said Annex VIII in order to finance the specific support provided for in Article 68 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 corresponds to the difference between the total amount for the specific support notified by the Member States and the amounts notified to finance the specific support in accordance with article 69(6)(a) of the same Regulation. Where a Member State implementing the single payment scheme decides to grant the support referred to in point (c) of Article 68(1), the amount notified to the Commission is to be included in the single payment scheme ceiling, as this support takes the form of an increase in the unit value and/or the number of the farmer's payment entitlements.\n(6) For Member States implementing, in 2012, the single area payment scheme provided for in Chapter 2 of Title V of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, the annual financial envelopes should be established in accordance with Article 123(1) of that Regulation.\n(7) For the sake of clarity, the maximum amount of funds available to Member States applying the single area payment scheme for granting separate sugar payments in 2012 under Article 126 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, established on the basis of their notification, should be published.\n(8) For the sake of clarity, the maximum amount of funds available to Member States applying the single area payment scheme for granting separate fruit and vegetables payments in 2012 pursuant to Article 127 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, established on the basis of their notification, should be published.\n(9) For Member States applying the single area payment scheme, the 2012 budgetary ceilings applicable to transitional payments for fruit and vegetables payments in 2012 in accordance with Article 128(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, should be published on the basis of their notification.\n(10) For the sake of clarity, the maximum amount of funds available to Member States applying the single area payment scheme for granting separate soft fruit payments in 2012 pursuant to Article 129 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, established on the basis of their notification, should be
