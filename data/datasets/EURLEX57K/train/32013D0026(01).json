Those euro area NCBs whose claims increase due to the increase in their capital key weightings from 1 January 2014 should therefore effect a compensatory transfer to the ECB, while the ECB should effect a compensatory transfer to those euro area NCBs whose claims decrease due to a decrease in their capital key weightings.\n(3) In accordance with the general principles of fairness, equal treatment and the protection of legitimate expectations underlying the Statute of the ESCB, those euro area NCBs whose relative share in the ECB\u2019s accumulated equity value increases due to the abovementioned adjustments should also effect a compensatory transfer to those euro area NCBs whose relative shares decrease.\n(4) The respective capital key weightings of each euro area NCB until 31 December 2013 and with effect from 1 January 2014 should be expressed as a percentage of the ECB\u2019s total capital as subscribed to by all euro area NCBs for the purpose of calculating the adjustment of the value of each euro area NCB\u2019s share in the ECB\u2019s accumulated equity value.\n(5) Accordingly, the adoption of a new ECB decision is required that repeals Decision ECB/2013/15 of 21 June 2013 laying down the measures necessary for the contribution to the European Central Bank\u2019s accumulated equity value and for adjusting the national central banks\u2019 claims equivalent to the transferred foreign reserve assets\u00a0(2), without prejudice to the implementation of all requirements under Article 4 of Decision ECB/2013/15.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 1 of Council Decision 2013/387/EU of 9 July 2013 on the adoption by Latvia of the euro on 1 January 2014\u00a0(3), in accordance with Article 140(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Latvia fulfils the necessary conditions for adoption of the euro and the derogation granted to it under Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession\u00a0(4) will be abrogated with effect from 1 January 2014,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision:\n(a) \u2018accumulated equity value\u2019 means the total of the ECB\u2019s reserves, revaluation accounts and provisions equivalent to reserves as calculated by the ECB as at 31 December 2013.
