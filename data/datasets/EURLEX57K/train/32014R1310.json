Article 58 of that Regulation provides that the Board shall have an autonomous budget which is not part of the Union budget.\n(2) Article 65(3) of Regulaion (EU) No 806/2014 provides that the Board shall determine and raise the contributions to the administrative expenditures of the Board which are due by each entity referred to in Article 2 of that Regulation. Those entities are credit institutions established in participating Member States within the meaning of Article 2 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013\u00a0(2) and parent undertakings, investment firms and financial institutions established in participating Member States, where they are subject to consolidated supervision carried out by the European Central Bank (ECB) in accordance with Article 4(1)(g) of Council Regulation (EU) No\u00a01024/2013. Branches, which are established in participating Member States, of credit institutions established in non-participating Member States should not be covered by this Regulation.\n(3) In accordance with Article 59 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, the contributions to the administrative expenditures of the Board shall constitute the revenues of Part 1 of the budget of the Board and shall cover the expenditures of Part 1 of the budget, which shall include at least staff remuneration, administrative, infrastructure, professional training and operational expenses.\n(4) In 2014 the Board will not have the dedicated infrastructure and operational capacity to collect contributions to cover its administrative expenditures for 2014 and 2015 from all the entities referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014. Nevertheless, in 2014 the Board will need to raise the revenues necessary to finance Part 1 of its budget to cover its administrative expenditures for those two years. The administrative expenditures of the Board for both the years 2014 and 2015 of the provisional period are estimated to EUR 22 million.\n(5) A temporary solution should be foreseen to allow the Board to collect contributions to cover its administrative expenditures for 2014 and 2015 while ensuring that the calculation and collection of the contributions may be carried out with the very limited resources of the Board and within a very short timeframe. This should be possible through establishing that the calculation and raising of the contributions to cover the administrative expenditures of the Board are performed on the basis of a two-step approach: a provisional system during the first stages of existence of the Board and a final system.\n(6) Only those entities that have been notified by the ECB, at the highest level of consolidation within the participating Member States, of the ECB's decision to consider them significant within the meaning of Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 and in accordance with Article 147(1) of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2014/17)\u00a0(3) and which are mentioned in the list published on the ECB's website on 4 September 2014, but excluding those significant entities which are subsidiaries of groups already taken into account (\u2018significant entities\u2019), should advance the full amount of instalments to cover the administrative expenditures of the Board during the provisional period. The entities which would be considered significant and notified as such by the ECB between 5 September 2014 and the end of the provisional period should not be subject to the obligation of payment of instalments on contributions. To this end, a provisional system of instalments on contributions (\u2018instalments\u2019) should be established that will enable the Board to collect, during the provisional period, instalments from significant entities to cover its expenditures.\n(7) That provisional system is proportionate because the entities which will pay instalments represent around 85 % of the total assets of the credit institutions covered by Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 and are easily identifiable. In this preliminary phase, such method for the calculation and collection of instalments should entail as little administrative burden as possible for both the Board and the entities concerned.\n(8) Once the Board has the necessary structure and operational capacity, the Commission will adopt a final system of administrative contributions on the basis of which contributions will be calculated and raised.\n(9) Under the final system, the contributions of the entities referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 shall be calculated and collected according to the final rules. The contributions of significant entities covered by the provisional system should be reassessed to take into account the amounts paid by them under that provisional system.\n(10) Any difference between the instalments paid on the basis of the provisional system and the contributions calculated in accordance with the final system should be settled in the calculation of the contributions to the administrative expenditures of the Board for the year following the end of the provisional period.\n(11) To allow the Board to become operational by 1 January 2015, as required by Article 98(1) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0806/2014, and to start performing the tasks listed in Article 99(3) of that Regulation, it is urgent to establish a simple and effective mechanism that can be rapidly and easily implemented during the initial stage of existence of the Board to allow it to acquire the necessary financial resources to establish its organisational structure and recruit the staff needed for carrying out its tasks under that Regulation.", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation lays down rules concerning:\n(a) a provisional system of instalments on contributions to the administrative expenditures of the Board during the provisional period;\n(b) the methodology for the calculation of the instalments to be collected in advance from each significant entity to cover the administrative expenditures of the Board during the provisional period;\n(c) the procedure and modalities for the collection of the instalments referred to in point (b) by the Board;\n(d) the arrangements for deferring the calculation and collection of the contributions due by entities referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 other than significant entities to cover the administrative expenditures of the Board during the provisional period;\n(e) the arrangements for adjusting the contributions due by the significant entities to the administrative expenditures of the Board after the provisional period to take into account any difference between the instalments paid in advance on the basis of that provisional system and the contributions due for the provisional period under the final system.", "Scope and objective\nThis Regulation applies to the entities referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014.\nThe instalments collected by the Board pursuant to this Regulation shall be exclusively used to cover its administrative expenditures during the provisional period.\nThe Board shall exercise sound financial management and budgetary control over all areas of its expenditures.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 shall apply.
