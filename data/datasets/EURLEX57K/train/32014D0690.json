Those surveys further show that Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu is widely spread in a large part of its potential area of establishment within the Union territory. In addition, the conditions for movement of susceptible plants set out in Decision 2006/464/EC are not feasible and appropriate for that large part of the Union territory.\n(2) Decision 2006/464/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/464/EC is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 September 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0169, 10.7.2000, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2006/464/EC of 27 June 2006 on provisional emergency measures to prevent the introduction into and the spread within the Community of Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu (OJ L\u00a0183, 5.7.2006, p.\u00a029)."}
