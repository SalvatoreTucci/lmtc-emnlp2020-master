Aid shall be granted to producers of casein and caseinates only if these products\n- have been produced from skimmed milk of Community origin or raw casein extracted from milk of Community origin,\n- meet the composition requirements of Annex I, II or III,\n- are packaged as stipulated in Article 3.\n2. Aid shall be paid on the basis of a written application to the competent authority stating:\n(i) the producer's name and address,\n(ii) the quantity of casein or caseinates covered by the application and its quality,\n(iii) the relevant production batch numbers.\n3. For the purposes of this Regulation a production batch must consist of products of identical quality made on the same day. However, where the total production of casein and caseinates of the establishment concerned during the previous calendar year did not exceed 1 000 tonnes, the production batch may consist of products made during the same calendar week.", "1. The aid per 100 kilograms of skimmed milk processed into casein or caseinates as indicated in paragraph 2 shall be ECU 7,94.\n2. For calculation of the aid it shall be considered that:\n(a) one kilogram of acid casein as defined in Annex I was produced from 32,17 kilograms of skimmed milk;\n(b) one kilogram of:\n- caseinate as defined in Annex I\nor\n- rennet-casein as defined in Annex I\nor\n- acid casein as defined in Annex II\nwas produced from 33,97 kilograms of skimmed milk;\n(c) one kilogram of:\n- rennet-casein as defined in Annex II\nor\n- caseinate as defined in Annex II\nwas produced from 35,77 kilograms of skimmed milk;\n(d) one kilogram of casein as defined in Annex III was produced from 24,97 kilograms of skimmed milk;\n(e) one kilogram of caseinate as defined in Annex III was produced from 28,57 kilograms of skimmed milk.\n3. Aid shall be granted at the rate applicable on the day of production of the casein or caseinates.\n4. The aid shall be converted into national currency using the representative rate applicable on the day of production of the casein or caseinates.", "Containers and packages of caseins and caseinates must show:\n(a) the description of the product and either the minimum or maximum or the actual percentage content of components indicated in Annexes I, II and III. The description to be shown for products referred to in Annex III is the following, as appropriate:\n'Casein/caseinates containing more than 5 % but not more than 17 %, calculated on the total with protein content, of simultaneously precipitated milk protein other than casein';\n(b) the words 'Regulation (EEC) No 2921/90';\n(c) the production batch number.", "1. Producers may not receive the aid unless they:\n(a) keep monthly abstracts of the quantities of milk and milk products, including casein and caseinates, delivered, produced, used and disposed of;\n(b) submit to surveillance by the competent authority.\n2. Monthly abstracts referred to in paragraph 1 (a) shall cover at least the following:\n(a) entries of milk and cream;\n(b) purchases of raw casein;\n(c) purchases of casein and caseinates;\n(d) quantities of casein and caseinates produced, identified by production batch number, with date of production;\n(e) quantities of other milk products produced;\n(f) quantities of casein and caseinates sold, with date of sale and name and address of the recipient;\n(g) losses, samples and quantities returned and replaced of milk, milk products, casein and caseinates.\nThe abstracts shall be supported in particular by delivery notes, invoices and the undertaking's records.", "1. To ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are complied with Member States shall carry out unannounced on-the-spot inspections to be decided on the basis of the establishment's production schedule. At least one inspection per period of seven production days shall be made.\nThe inspections shall involve the taking of samples from each production batch and shall cover the conditions of production, quantity and composition of the casein and caseinates produced.\n2. The inspection referred to in paragraph 1 shall be supplemented, at intervals depending on the quantity of casein and caseinates produced, by thorough scrutiny and sampling in order to reconcile the information given in the aid application and the monthly abstract referred to in Article 4 with relevant commercial documents and product stocks actually held.\nThese further checks must cover at least 25 % of the total quantity covered by aid applications and each establishment must be checked at least once every six months.\n3. Should\n(a) significant irregularities affecting 5 % or more of the aid operations checked,\n(b) significant discrepancies by comparison with the recipient's previous operations\nbe discovered, the Member State shall intensify the inspection operations provided for in paragraph 2 and immediately inform the Commission.\n4. Member States shall recover sums wrongly paid out, plus interest. The interest rates to be applied shall be those fixed pursuant to Article 3 or 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 411/88 (1) and shall be calculated from the date of payment of the aid.\n5. Except in cases of force majeure, if a check reveals that the aid applied for or paid is higher than that actually due under the provisions of this Regulation:\n- it shall be reduced by 15 % if the difference is less than 8 % and by 50 % if the difference is between 8 % and 20 %. If it has already been paid, 15 % or 50 % of the amount, as appropriate, must be repaid,\n- no aid shall be granted, or all aid shall be repaid, if the difference is more than 20 %.\n6. If the check shows that the difference referred to in paragraph 5 stems from an error in the application made either deliberately or by gross negligence, the applicant shall be debarred from aid for six months from the date of notification of such exclusion.", "Regulation (EEC) No 756/70 is hereby repealed.\nSecurities lodged under the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 4 (1) (b) of that Regulation shall be released as soon as the Member State has introduced the control arrangements specified in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2204/90 and issued the authorizations specified in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2742/90 (1) and for those quantities which, on 14 October 1990, have not yet reached the destinations specified in the second and third indents of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 756/70.
