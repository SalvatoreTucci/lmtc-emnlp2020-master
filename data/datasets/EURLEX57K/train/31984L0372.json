With effect from 1 October 1984, Member States shall not, on grounds relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system:\n- refuse, in respect of a type of motor vehicle, to grant EEC type-approval, to issue the document referred to in the last indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 70/156/EEC, or to grant national type-approval, or\n- prohibit the entry into service of such vehicles,\nif the sound level and the exhaust system of this type of vehicle or of the vehicles concerned conform to the provisions of Directive 70/157/EEC, as amended by this Directive.\n2. With effect from 1 October 1985, Member States:\n- may no longer issue the document referred to in the last indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 70/156/EEC in respect of a type of motor vehicle of which the sound level and exhaust system do not comply with the provisions of Directive 70/157/EEC, as amended by this Directive,\n- may refuse to grant national type-approval in respect of a type of motor vehicle of which the sound level and exhaust system do not comply with the provisions of Directive 70/157/EEC, as amended by this Directive.\n3.

Approach speed\nThe vehicle must approach the line AA' at a steady speed corresponding to the lower of the following two speeds:\n- the speed corresponding to an engine speed equal to three-quarters of the speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power,\n- 50 km/h.\nHowever, if in the case of vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission having more than two discrete ratios there is a change-down to first gear during the test, the manufacturer may select either of the following test procedures:\n- the speed, V, of the vehicle shall be increased to a maximum of 60 km/h in order to avoid such a change-down, or\n- the speed, V, shall remain at 50 km/h and the fuel supply to the engine shall be limited to 95 % of the supply necessary for full load. This condition is considered to be satisfied:\n- in the case of a spark-ignition engine, when the angle of the throttle opening is 90 %, and\n- in the case of a compression-ignition engine, when the movement of the central rack of the injection pump is limited to 90 % of its travel.\nIf the vehicle is equipped with an automatic transmission which has no manual override, it must be tested at different approach speeds, namely 30, 40 and 50 km/h, or at three-quarters of maximum road speed if this value is lower. The test result shall be that obtained at the speed which produces the maximum sound level.'\nPoint 5.2.2.4.3.3.1.1 is hereby replaced by the following:\n'5.2.2.4.3.3.1.1. Vehicles in categories M1 and N1 equipped with a manually operated gearbox having not more than four forward gear ratios must be tested in second gear.\nVehicles in these categories equipped with a manually operated gearbox having more than four forward gear ratios must be tested in second and third gears successively. Only overall gear ratios intended for normal road use shall be considered. The arithmetic mean of the sound levels recorded for each of these two conditions shall be calculated.\nHowever, the vehicles in category M1 having more than four forward gears and equipped with an engine developing a maximum power greater than 140 kW, and whose permissible maximum-power/maximum-mass ratio exceeds 75 kW/t, may be tested in third gear only, provided that the speed at which the rear of the vehicle passes the line BB' in third gear is greater than 61 km/h.'\nPoint 5.2.2.4.3.3.2 is hereby replaced by the following:\n'5.2.2.4.3.3.2. Automatic transmission equipped with manual override.\nThe test shall be conducted with the selector in a position recommended by the manufacturer for \"normal\" driving.'"}
