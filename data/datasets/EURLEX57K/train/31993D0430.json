Key criteria  These criteria are based on the major environmental impacts as highlighted in the cradle-to-grave assessment. The threshold levels must all be achieved in order to qualify for an eco-label.\n(i) Energy consumption\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 0,23 kWh of electrical energy per kg of washload in an IEC 456 test for a cotton wash without prewash at 60 \u00b0C using cold fill only.\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 0,11 kWh of electrical energy per kg of washload in an IEC 456 test for a cotton wash without prewash at 40 \u00b0C using cold fill only.\n(ii) Water consumption\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 17 litres of water per kg of washold in an IEC 456 test for a cotton wash without prewash at either 60 or 40 \u00b0C.\n(iii) Detergent consumption\nThe machine must lose less than or equal to 5 % of detergent in an IEC 456 test with the detergent added via the detergent drawer.\nB. Best practice criteria  Best practice criteria relate to features of a washing machine which make a smaller contribution to the overall environmental impact of the product. The qualifying levels for these criteria reflect best environmental practice.  All of these criteria must be achieved in order to qualify for an eco-label.\n(i) User instructions\n1. The machine must have clear markings on it identifying the settings appropriate according to fabric type and laundry code.\n2. The machine must have clear markings on it identifying energy and water saving programmes and options.\n3. Clear instructions must be made available to the consumer providing:\n- advice to use a full load rather than part loads wherever possible,\n- advice about the best wash temperature to use according to the fabric type,\n- advice on varying the detergent dose according to water hardness, load size and the degree of soil,\n- advice on the machine installation which makes the most appropriate use of the hot and cold fill, if available on the machine, including advice based on the fuel used for home water heating,\n- advice on sorting fabrics appropriately,\n- advice on situations where a prewash, if available, is likely to be required,\n- information about the energy consumption and the water consumption of the machine for different temperature settings and for different load settings and according to whether hot and cold fill is an option,\n- advice about the machine being made of materials which are recyclable and that it should be disposed of accordingly.\n(ii) Encouragement to recycling\nWhere they occur in components in quantities greater than 50 g the following polymeric materials must have a permanent marking identifying the material:\n- polypropylene,\n- polystyrene,\n- PVC,\n- HDPE,\n- LDPE,\n- ABS,\n- polyamide,\n- other.\nThe marking must use the symbols or abbreviated terms given in ISO 1043.\nC. Performance criteria  (i) Wash performance\nThe machine must achieve at least a minimum of 20 % stain removal based on the carbon black soiled sample EMPA test cloth in an IEC 456 test at 60 \u00b0C.\nThe machine must achieve at least a minimum of 6 % stain removal based on the carbon black soiled sample EMPA test cloth in an IEC 456 test at 40 \u00b0C.\n(ii) Rinse efficiency\nThe machine must achieve at least a minimum rinsing efficiency of 60 dilutions as defined in IEC 456."}
