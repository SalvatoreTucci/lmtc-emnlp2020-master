Under these circumstances of relatively high world market prices, imports of sugar products covered by Article 36(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 of 30 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards trade with third countries in the sugar sector\u00a0(3) are not likely to disturb the Union market and consequently no additional duties on these imports should be imposed. Taking into account the fundamentals of the world and Union sugar markets, this situation is unlikely to change significantly for the next two marketing years, i.e. till the end of the Union quota regime.The Commission monitors constantly the sugar market and shall take any appropriate measures if necessary.\n(4) As long as additional duties are not imposed, there is no need to fix the representative prices which are used to calculate them.\n(5) It is then appropriate to derogate from the application of Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 until the end of the marketing year 2014/2015.\n(6) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 892/2012 should therefore be repealed.\n(7) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006, the additional import duties shall not be applied to the products referred to in that Article until 30 September 2015.", "Implementing Regulation (EU) No 892/2012 is repealed.
