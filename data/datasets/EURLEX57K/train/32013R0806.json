At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of circumvention in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively to the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant\u2019s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(13) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 10 of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\n(14) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party\u2019s making itself known within the time-limits indicated in Article 4 of this Regulation.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION\n(15) In cases in which an interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time-limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(16) Where it is found that an interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available.\n(17) If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION\n(18) The investigation will be concluded, pursuant to Article 11(5) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the entry into force of this Regulation.\nJ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(19) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(6).\nK.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(20) Interested parties may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade.
