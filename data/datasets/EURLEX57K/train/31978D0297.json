Whereas it may be concluded that the aid granted to the Belgian coal-mining industry in 1977 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;\nWhereas this applies even when account is taken of aids to the coal mines under Decision 73/287/ECSC;\nIII\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that any aid it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof ; whereas the Commission must therefore be informed in particular of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium is hereby authorized in respect of the calendar year 1977 to grant aid totalling Bfrs 5 541 700 000 to the Belgian coal-mining industry to cover pit operating losses as follows:    - to the Campine coalfield : Bfrs 3 158 600 000,\n- to the Sud coalfield : Bfrs 2 383 100 000.", "The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium shall notify the Commission by 31 May 1978 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision, and in particular of the amount of the payments made and the manner in which they are apportioned.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 March 1978.\nFor the Commission\nGuido BRUNNER\nMember of the Commission"}
