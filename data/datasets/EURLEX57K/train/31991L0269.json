MARKING OF ELECTRICAL APPARATUS COVERED BY AN INSPECTION CERTIFICATE\nIf a type of electrical apparatus which is not in conformity with the harmonized standards has been granted an inspection certificate as provided for in Article 9, the distinctive Community mark must be supplemented at least by the following:\n1. The symbol 'S' signifying that it is an electrical apparatus suitable for gassy mines covered by an inspection certificate. This symbol shall immediately follow the distinctive Community mark as indicated below.\n2. The last two digits of the year of issue of the inspection certificate.\n3. The serial number of the inspection certificate for that year.\n4. The name or symbol of the body approved to issue the certificate.\n5. The name of the manufacturer or his registered trade mark.\n6. The manufacturer's type identification.\n7. The manufacturer's serial number.\n8. If the testing station considers that it is necessary to indicate special conditions for safe use, the sign '\u00f7' shall be placed after the certificate reference.\n9. Any marking normally required by the construction standards for the electrical apparatus.\n10. Any supplementary marking considered necessary by the body approved to issue the certificates.\n'"}
