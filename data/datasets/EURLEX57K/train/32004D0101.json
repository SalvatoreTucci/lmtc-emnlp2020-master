However, the model of certificate applicable to intra-Community trade when taking place after that date has been omitted.\n(4) Consequently, it is necessary to provide models of certificate for trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of bovine species collected, processed and stored before 31 December 2004, carried out as of 1 January 2005. Pursuant to Article 11.2 of the Directive, however, the current models of certificates for imports should be updated in a separate instrument.\n(5) With regard to intra-Community trade, and in the interest of clarity, it is necessary to amend the Annex D to Directive 88/407/EEC in order to precise the two different models of certificate applicable for intra-Community trade in bovine semen in accordance with the former or the new provisions of the said Directive.\n(6) Although the trade in stocks of semen collected before 31 December 2004 should be transitory and progressively phased out, thus rendering the corresponding model of certificate obsolete, the long lasting stocking capabilities for the product concerned make it impossible at present to fix a date for its deletion.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.", "main_body": ["Annex D of Directive 88/407/EEC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply as of 1 January 2005.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 January 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 194, 22.7.1988, p. 10.
