The quality report shall contain both quantitative and qualitative information. The Commission (Eurostat) shall provide the results for those quantitative indicators which can be calculated from data provided by Member States. Member States shall comment on the indicators and assist Eurostat with interpreting them, in the light of their collection methodology, and shall provide the remaining quantitative indicators and qualitative information.\nMember States shall provide:\n\u2014 a report covering the quality aspects of Annexes I to IV to Regulation (EC) No 295/2008.

Punctuality means the delay between the date of release of the data and the target date (the date by which the data should have been delivered).\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accessibility and clarity\nAccessibility and clarity means the conditions and modalities by which users can obtain, use and interpret data.\nSECTION IV\nSeries of quantitative indicators to be provided by Member States regarding accuracy (and reliability)\nThe quantitative indicators described in this section need to be provided only for the statistics listed in Annexes I to IV to Regulation (EC) No 295/2008, as specified below.
