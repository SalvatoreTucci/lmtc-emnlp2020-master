Such a channel raster aims at enabling compatibility and facilitating coexistence of the applications allowed in these bands.\n(3) The frequency plan imposes a channel raster of 12,5 kHz in the 169,4000-169,4750 MHz band and a channel raster of 50 kHz in the 169,4875-169,5875 MHz band.\n(4) Following the adoption of Decision 2005/928/EC further investigations of the technical parameters defined in this Decision revealed that the channel raster arrangements in the bands 169,4000-169,4750 MHz and 169,4875-169,5875 MHz are considered unduly restrictive given the technological development. Allowing several channel raster options will increase the flexibility for the users to choose the optimal bandwidth up to 50 kHz in accordance with quality requirements of the specific applications.\n(5) The European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) has confirmed that increasing the channel raster options in these bands can and should be allowed.\n(6) Decision 2005/928/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. By amending this Decision channels up to 50 kHz will be possible in the 169,4000-169,4750 MHz and 169,4875-169,5875 MHz bands.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/928/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
