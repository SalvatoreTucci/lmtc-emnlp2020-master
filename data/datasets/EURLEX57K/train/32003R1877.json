This situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the marketing year 2003/04.\n(2) In order to remedy this situation, it is appropriate to grant export refunds in respect of zones which may be supplied by the Community. The particular circumstances of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the refunds, and therefore to apply Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 enabling the amount of the export refund to be fixed by tendering procedure.\n(3) It should be stated that the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1948/2002(4), apply to this invitation to tender.\n(4) With a view to sound market management, the tender should be limited to certain zones listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2145/92/94(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3304/94(6), while some destinations should be excluded.\n(5) Under Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 816/2003(8), the amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides that in such cases the operative event for the agricultural exchange rate is the final day for the submission of tenders.
