That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns a new use of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10) (Safizym X), as a feed additive for ducks, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10) was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1453/2004\u00a0(2), without a time limit for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 943/2005\u00a0(3), without a time limit for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1810/2005\u00a0(4) and for ten years for piglets (weaned) by Commission Regulation (EC) No 497/2007\u00a0(5).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for ducks. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 10\u00a0July 2007 that the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10) (Safizym X) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment\u00a0(6). It further concluded that that preparation does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation for this additional animal category. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation is efficacious in digestibility of feedingstuffs. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
