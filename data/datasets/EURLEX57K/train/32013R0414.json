It is therefore appropriate to provide for an adapted authorisation procedure for such cases.\n(3) The terms and conditions relating to the making available on the market and use of a biocidal product should be based on the evaluation made of the product. It is therefore appropriate to require that biocidal products authorised in accordance with this Regulation are authorised on the same terms and conditions as the evaluated biocidal products to which they refer, with the exception of the details on which the products differ.\n(4) Since this Regulation specifies a procedure provided for by Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, which applies from 1 September
