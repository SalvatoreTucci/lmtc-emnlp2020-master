The veterinary authorities of the United States of America had therefore to suspend all certification following that outbreak.\n(5) The certificates for meat products and meat preparations consisting of or containing poultry meat are laid down in Commission Decision 97/221/EC of 28 February 1997 laying down the animal health conditions and model veterinary certificates in respect of imports of meat products from third countries(12) and Commission Decision 2000/572/EC of 8 September 2000 laying down animal and public health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of minced meat and meat preparations from third countries(13) and make reference to the animal health requirements set out in Decision 94/984/EC for fresh poultry meat.\n(6) The veterinary authorities of the United States of America have communicated their regionalisation measures to the Commission in accordance with the Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in trade in live animals and animal products(14).\n(7) It is possible to regionalise the territory of the United States of America for live poultry and poultry meat exports to the Community.\n(8) Commission Decision 97/222/EC of 28 February 1997 laying down the list of third countries from which the Member States authorise the importation of meat products(15) lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of meat products and establishes treatment regimes in order to lower the risk of disease transmission via such products. The treatment that has to be applied to such products depends on the health status of the country of origin in relation to the species the meat is obtained from; therefore it is necessary to restrict imports of poultrymeat products originating in the restricted parts of the United States of America to those treated by a temperature of at least 70 \u00c2\u00b0 Celsius throughout the product.\n(9) Sanitary control measures applicable to such products allow the exclusion from the scope of this Decision of channelled imports of raw material for the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs and pharmaceutical or technical products.\n(10) The provisions of this Decision will be reviewed in the light of the disease evolution and further information received from the authorities of the United States of America.\n(11) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not given a favourable opinion,", "main_body": ["1.
