SAMPLING METHODS 1.  SAMPLING 1.1.  Sampling points For each zone referred to, a number of sampling points must be selected so as to maximize the  chances of detecting pathogens. Account must be taken of parameters having an effect on the  development of the pathogenic agents, such as stocking density, water flows, and the development  cycle of the molluscs.\nFor a given zone at least three sampling points must be selected. The number of points must be  increased for large zones containing several discrete areas of cultivation of the susceptible  species.\nWhenever possible, at least one sample must be taken from natural beds. Any molluscs showing  abnormalities (abnormal growth, gaping shells) must be selected.\n1.2.  Sampling period and frequency The frequency of inspection is based on the infection period, and inspections have to take place  thereafter. Inspection periods must also take account of the transfer of molluscs, which generally  takes place in spring and autumn. Sampling should therefore be carried out twice a year  (spring/autumn) for Mikrocytos and for iridovirus.\n1.3.  Sampling size During the initial two-year period which precedes the granting of approved status, the sample size  for each sampling point is 150 or a sufficient number to ensure detection at a 95  % confidence  level of pathogen carriers at a prevalence of 2  %.\n2.  SHIPMENT OF SAMPLES All molluscs sampled must be delivered to the approved laboratory within 24 hours after sampling.  They must be packed in accordance with current standards in order to keep them in good condition. A  label clearly stating the place of sampling and the health history (if any) must attached to the  sample.\n3.  MACROSCOPIC EXAMINATION The molluscs must be opened carefully so as not to damage the tissues, in particular the mantle,  gills, heart and digestive gland. Anomalies and lesions of the tissues, as well as any shell  deformities, shell-boring organisms and conspicuous mantle inhabitants, must be noted.\n4.  EXAMINATION OF STOCKS WHERE ABNORMAL MORTALITIES OCCUR Whenever abnormal mortalities occur in stocks of bivalve molluscs an urgent investigation must be  carried out to determine the aetiology. In field, an abnormal mortality is a sudden sizeable  mortality which occurs in a short time between two observations during low tide cycle. In hatchery  a mortality is considered abnormal when the farmer cannot obtain larvae during a period which  included successive spawns from different broodstocks. In nursery a mortality is considered  abnormal when a sudden sizeable mortality occurs in a short time on many tubes.\nThe sample taken must consist of 150 individual oysters and must be handled in accordance with the  procedure defined for histological analysis. This technique must be used initially, before any  other type of examination. The samples are fixed, preferably in Carson's fixative, which allows  re-use of the sample for electron microscopy.\nB.  DIAGNOSTIC METHODS (a)  Mikrocytos mackini 1.  PREPARATION AND EXAMINATION OF SAMPLES FOR MIKROCYTOSIS 1.1.  Cytological examination Cut a section through the abscesses, ulcers or green pustules, remove the excess water by placing  the sample on blotting paper, then blot on a slide the sample corrresponding to the section which  passes through the infected tissue. The slides are dried in air and then fixed with methanol (2 to  3 minutes).\nThe slides are stained using any equivalent Wright-Giemsa stain (e.g. Merck's Hemacolor Kit or  Baxter's Diff-Quick) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Dip the slides in the  first bath for 4 to 5 seconds, then immerse immediately in the second bath (3 seconds). Rinse with  tap water, dry completely in cold or warm air, and mount in synthetic resin (Eukitt).\nThe parasite, 1-3 \u00ecm in diameter, appears included in haemocytes or free of the host cells and has  blue cytoplasm and a small red nucleus. An observation time of 5 minutes per slide is sufficient.\n1.2.  Histological examination For histological sections, cut a section through the body of the oyster including pustules,  abscesses and ulcers if any are present. Then place the sample in a fixative liquid such as  Davidson's, Bouin's or Carsons's. The last-named enables the samples to be reused for electron  microscopy if necessary. The ratio of volume of tissue to volume of fixative must be no more than  1:  10.\nThe samples are subsequently handled in accordance with the classical histological methods. Several  non-specific stains allow Mikrocytos to be observed: haemalum-eosin, Masson's trichrome. These  examples are not exhaustive. It is recommended that two sections per oyster be examined.\nThe stages of Mikrocytos, intracellular parasite 2/3 \u00ecm in diameter can be observed inside cells of  the vesicular connective tissue on the periphery of the lesions, in muscle cells and in hemocytes  within the lesions.\n(b)  Oyster Velar Disease 1.  PREPARATION AND EXAMINATION OF SAMPLES FOR IRIDOVIRUS 1.1.  Cytological examination Cut the digestive gland and gills along a sagittal plane, soak up excess water by applying  absorbent paper, then press that part of the cut sample which passes through affected organs  against a glass slide. The slides are dried in air and then fixed with methanol (2 to 3 minutes).\nThe slides are stained using Merck's Hemacolor Kit (with reagent solution 2 (ref. 11956) for red  staining and reagent solution 3 (ref. 11957) for blue staining). Dip the slides in the first bath  for 4 to 5 seconds, then immerse immediately in the second bath (3 seconds). Rinse with tap water,  dry completely in cold or warm air, and mount in synthetic resin (Eukitt).\nIt is sufficient to examine each slide for 5 minutes.\nThe cytoplasm of infected cells stains blue, and it contains a weakly-staining red nucleus and an  inclusion body, variable in size, stained bright red.\n1.2.  Histological examination Cut the visceral mass and the gills with small scissors along a sagittal plane, and place the  sample in a fixative (Davidson's, Bouin's or Carson fluid); the last-named is suitable for samples  which may be examined later by electron microscopy if necessary. There should be at least 10 parts  of fluid to every part of sample by volume.\nThe samples are then treated by conventional histological procedures.\nMany non-specific stains show up iridoviral inclusion bodies: haemalun-eosin, Masson's trichrome  and others. Two sections from each oyster should be examined.\nCiliated velar epithelium with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (1,2 to 2,4 \u00ecm diameter) which are  spherical, dense and basophilic in early stage infections but become irregular and less basophilic  as virion form. Inclusions bodies occasionally occur in velar supporting esophageal and oral  epithelia and rarely in mantle epithelium.\n1.3  Electron microscopy Velar epithelial cells with viroplasm (observed as inclusion bodies in histology) that form the  viral particles. Viral particles with icosahedral symmetry (228 \u00b1 7 nm diameter) and with a capsid  consisting of two bilayered membranes. Complete viral particles have a dense inner core separated  from the capsid by moderately dense zone.\nANNEX III\n1.
