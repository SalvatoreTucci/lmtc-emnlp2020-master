The European Central Bank (ECB), although not subject to Directive 2004/18/EC, intends to apply the same thresholds for its public tender procedures.\n(2) Research and development contracts in the field of banknote security require special security measures and can therefore not be put out to tender. It should be clarified that such contracts fall under the exception laid down in Article 6(1)(c) of Decision ECB/2007/5\u00a0(4).\n(3) Following a recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union\u00a0(5), it is necessary to clarify that the exemptions for cooperation agreements between the ECB and national central banks (NCBs) and cooperation agreements between the ECB and other Union institutions and bodies, international organisations or government agencies not only cover cooperation in the fulfilment of public tasks, but also auxiliary services for the fulfilment of public tasks.\n(4) Following recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union\u00a0(6), the time limit for raising objections to the ECB\u2019s requirements needs to be refined further.\n(5) For reasons of transparency, and without prejudice to Decision ECB/2004/3 of 4 March 2004 on public access to European Central Bank documents\u00a0(7), unsuccessful candidates and tenderers should be entitled to receive copies of all internal documents relating to the evaluation of their application or tender and, under certain conditions, copies of documents relating to the evaluation of the successful tender.\n(6) It is necessary to clarify that in exceptional, duly justified cases, extensions of a contract may exceed the initial term of a contract.\n(7) Decision ECB/2007/5 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDecision ECB/2007/5 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1 the following definition is added:\n\u2018(q) \u201cresearch and development contracts in the field of banknote security\u201d means contracts related to theoretical work or practical experimentation, analysis and research carried out under controlled conditions either:\n\u2014 for acquiring new knowledge and inventing new or improving existing materials, manufacturing processes or devices for the origination, production, transport, issuance, authentication and destruction of euro banknotes (including the origination materials of the latter),\n\u2014 for initiating the manufacture of new or improving existing materials, products or devices for the origination, production, transport, issuance, authentication and destruction of euro banknotes (including the origination materials of the latter).\n2.
