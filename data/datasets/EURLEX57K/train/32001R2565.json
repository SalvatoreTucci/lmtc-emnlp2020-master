particular Article 1(4) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) The quantities of certain agricultural products that may be imported from certain countries with a total exemption from customs duty subject to tariff quotas, ceilings or reference quantities are laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1349/2000, (EC) No 1727/2000, (EC) No 2290/2000, (EC) No 2433/2000, (EC) No 2434/2000, (EC) No 2435/2000, (EC) No 2341/2000 and (EC) No 2766/2000 from 1 July 2000 and in Annex A(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2851/2000 from 1 January 2001.\n(2) The Commission must open tariff quotas for sheepmeat and goatmeat for 2002. Those quotas must subsequently be managed in accordance with the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 of 26 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 as regards the import and export of products in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector(13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 272/2001(14).\n(3) A carcass-weight equivalent needs to be fixed in order to ensure a proper functioning of the tariff quotas. Furthermore, since certain tariff quotas provide the option of importing either the live animals or their meat, a conversion factor is required.\n(4) Since imports are managed on a calendar-year basis, the quantities fixed for 2002 are the sum of half of the quantity for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 and half of the quantity for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.\n(5) Accordingly it is necessary to prepare this Commission Regulation establishing Community tariff quotas for 2002 for sheep, goats, sheepmeat and goatmeat falling within CN codes 0104 10 30, 0104 10 80, 0104 20 90 and 0204.\n(6) Following difficulties in the sheep sector in Uruguay due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and in order to avoid a disruption in the supplies of this country to the European Community, provision should be made to derogate from Article 11(1) and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 and to allow, on an exceptional basis, the extension of the validity until 25 January 2002 for the documents of origin and the import licences issued pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/2000 of 21 December 2000 opening Community tariff quotas for 2001 for sheep, goats, sheepmeat and goatmeat falling within CN codes 0104 10 30, 0104 10 80, 0104 20 10, 0104 20 90 and 0204 and derogating from Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 as regards the import and export of products in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector(15), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 272/2001.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheepmeat and Goatmeat,", "main_body": ["This Regulation opens Community tariff quotas for the sheepmeat and goatmeat sectors for the period 1 January to 31 December 2002.", "The customs duties applicable to imports into the Community of sheep, goats, sheepmeat and goatmeat falling within CN codes 0104 10 30, 0104 10 80, 0104 20 90 and 0204 originating in the countries indicated in the Annex shall be suspended or reduced in accordance with the provisions laid down in this Regulation.", "1.
