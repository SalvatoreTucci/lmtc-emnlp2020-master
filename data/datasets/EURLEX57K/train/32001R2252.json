A possibility for an annual financing agreement also to amend, as appropriate, provisions laid down in another prior annual financing agreement, inter alia, the period of commitment, should be provided for.\n(2) Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 provides that the Commission shall apply the decommitment rule set out in Article 31(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1447/2001(4), laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds. As no Commission decision conferring management to agencies in applicant countries could be taken in 2000 it is appropriate to extend the limit date for decommitment of the 2000 commitment.\n(3) Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 limits eligibility to expenditure paid by beneficiaries from the date of the Commission decision conferring financial management on the agency designated by the applicant country. In order to permit a smooth introduction of the system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 and to enable concerned parties to benefit properly from it, it is appropriate to exclude from this provision expenditure on feasibility and related studies concerning selected projects and expenditure incurred under technical assistance.\n(4) Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 provides for no charges to be levied on interest earned by the Sapard euro account, except those of a fiscal nature. However, in order to ensure the full use of Community funds for Sapard objectives, this exception should also be eliminated.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee of the European Agriculture Guarantee and Guidance Fund (EAGGF),", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 is amended as follows:\n1.
