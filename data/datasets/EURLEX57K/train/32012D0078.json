That information was also made public by electronic means.\n(4) Within the period of three months from those publications, a number of companies indicated an interest in taking over the role of participant for certain of the substances and product types concerned. However, those companies subsequently failed to submit a complete dossier.\n(5) Pursuant to Articles 12(4) and 12(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the substances and product types concerned should therefore not be included in Annexes I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.\n(6) In the interest of legal certainty, it is appropriate to specify the date after which biocidal products of the product types listed in the Annex to this Decision containing the active substances listed in that Annex should no longer be placed on the market.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["The substances indicated in the Annex to this Decision shall not be included for the product types concerned in Annexes I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.", "For the purposes of Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, biocidal products of the product types listed in the Annex to this Decision which contain the active substances listed in that Annex shall no longer be placed on the market with effect from 1 February 2013.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 February 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJanez POTO\u010cNIK\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 325, 11.12.2007, p. 3.\nANNEX\nSubstances and product types not to be included in Annexes I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC\nName EC number CAS number Product type Rapporteur Member State\nCyclohexylhydroxydiazene 1-oxide, potassium salt  66603-10-9 6 AT\nCyclohexylhydroxydiazene 1-oxide, potassium salt  66603-10-9 7 AT\nCyclohexylhydroxydiazene 1-oxide, potassium salt  66603-10-9 9 AT\nCyclohexylhydroxydiazene 1-oxide, potassium salt  66603-10-9 10 AT\nCyclohexylhydroxydiazene 1-oxide, potassium salt  66603-10-9 12 AT\nCyclohexylhydroxydiazene 1-oxide, potassium salt  66603-10-9 13 AT\nDiphenoxarsin-10-yl oxide 200-377-3 58-36-6 9 FR\nGlyoxal 203-474-9 107-22-2 12 FR\n1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin 204-258-7 118-52-5 12 NL\nTosylchloramide sodium 204-854-7 127-65-1 11 ES\nDisodium tetraborate, anhydrous 215-540-4 1330-43-4 11 NL\nCopper 231-159-6 7440-50-8 2 FR\nCopper 231-159-6 7440-50-8 4 FR\nCopper 231-159-6 7440-50-8 5 FR\nCopper 231-159-6 7440-50-8 11 FR\nCopper sulphate 231-847-6 7758-98-7 1 FR\nCopper sulphate 231-847-6 7758-98-7 4 FR\nCalcium hypochlorite 231-908-7 7778-54-3 1 IT\nBoric acid 233-139-2 10043-35-3 22 NL\nTrimagnesium diphosphide 235-023-7 12057-74-8 20 DE\nChloralose 240-016-7 15879-93-3 15 PT\nChloralose 240-016-7 15879-93-3 23 PT\nAluminium phosphide 244-088-0 20859-73-8 20 DE\n1,3-dichloro-5-ethyl-5-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione 401-570-7 89415-87-2 12 NL\nMethyl neodecanamide 414-460-9 105726-67-8 19 ES\nTetrachlorodecaoxide complex 420-970-2 92047-76-2 5 DE\n3-benzo(b)thien-2-yl-5,6-dihydro-1,4,2-oxathiazine,4-oxide 431-030-6 163269-30-5 9 PT\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 2 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 2 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 3 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 3 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 4 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 4 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 7 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 7 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 9 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 9 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 10 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 10 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 11 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 11 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 12 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 12 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 20 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 20 FR"}
