whereas this operation presupposes a traffic between Portugal and Spain which cannot be considered as taking place within the framework of commercial trade between Member States in view of the fact that the production of the sugar  in question has to be attributed to the quotas of the Portuguese undertaking; whereas under these conditions it is justified that such operations should not be subject to the monetary compensatory amounts which are applicable between these Member  States; whereas for these same reasons and owing to the fact that operations do not represent, in particular within the meaning of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1677/85, any risk of disturbance in the trade in agricultural products between these two  Member States, they should similarly not be subject to the accession compensatory amounts which are applicable to the said trade; whereas to enable the two Member States concerned to supervise the operations in question, provision should be made for the  use of the 'information sheet' provided for by Council Decision 77/415/EEC of 3 June 1977 accepting, on behalf of the Community, several annexes to the international convention on the simplification and harmonization of customs procedures (8); whereas  it should be indicated on the 'information sheet' that monetary compensatory amounts and accession compensatory amounts do not apply to these operations in accordance with this Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["During the marketing years 1991/92 and 1992/93 no monetary compensatory amounts shall be applied to sugars falling within CN codes 1701 99 10 and 1701 12 90 produced during those marketing years and in transit from Spain to Portugal within  the framework of operations carried out by virtue of the transitional arrangements provided for in the third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 24 (1a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81.", "During the marketing years 1991/92 and 1992/93 no accession compensatory amounts shall be applied:\n(a) to sugar beets falling within CN code 1212 91 10 harvested during these marketing years and in transit from Portugal to Spain,\nand\n(b) to sugars falling within CN codes 1701 99 10 and 1701 12 90 produced during these marketing years and in transit from Spain to Portugal, within the framework of operations carried out by virtue of the transitional arrangements provided for in the  third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 24 (1a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81.", "1. The two Member States concerned shall take the measures necessary in order to guarantee that the operations are carried out under official control and that the quantities of sugar sent from Spain to Portugal correspond for each marketing  year to the quantity of the transitional arrangements provided for in the third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 24 (1a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81.\n2. For the purpose of applying paragraph 1, the two Member States concerned shall utilize the 'information sheet' for facilitating the temporary export of goods sent from one country to another for processing, working or repair appearing in Appendix I  to Annex E8 of Decision 77/415/EEC. Under heading C of this sheet 'non-application of monetary compensatory amounts and accession compensatory amounts in conformity with Regulation (EEC) No 1476/91 (OJ No L 138, 1. 6. 1991, p. 77) should be indicated.
