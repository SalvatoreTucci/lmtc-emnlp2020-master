whereas these limits may be modified pursuant to Article 7(3);\nWhereas any modification of these quantitative limits may not lead to Community consumption of controlled substances exceeding the quantitative limits established according to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer;\nWhereas Article 4(8) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 defines the total calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which producers and importers may place on the market or use for their own account in the period 1 January to 31 December 1995 and in each 12-month period thereafter; whereas this corresponds to a quantity of 8 079 ODP tonnes;\nWhereas the Commission is required, under Article 4(8), in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16, to assign a quota to each producer or importer when the total quantity of HCFCs which producers and importers place on the market or use for their own account reaches 80% of the quantitative limit established or at the latest on 1 January 2000, whichever comes first;\nWhereas the 80% threshold has been reached in the year 1997; whereas it is likely that this will also be the case in 1998 making it necessary to assign placing on the market quotas for HCFCs for 1998;\nWhereas the Commission is required under Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 to allocate quotas for controlled substances to undertakings each year in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 16;\nWhereas the Commission has published a notice to importers in the European Community of controlled substances that deplete the ozone layer (2) and has thereby received applications for import quotas;\nWhereas the applications for import quotas of the chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115 and halons exceed the import quotas available under Article 7(2); therefore the Commission cannot satisfy the applications;\nWhereas some of the applications from the producers of ODS in the Community have been made for specific contingency purposes of possible breakdown of production, technical failure and non-availability of the substances in the Community; whereas requests by a producer to import under a contingency quota can only be considered following interruption to normal supply and non-availability of the substances within the Community;\nWhereas the allocation of individual quotas to producers and importers is based on the principles of continuity, equality and proportionality; whereas, in establishing quotas, the Commission has been guided by the need to reduce further the production, import and use of substances which damage the ozone layer while interfering in the market as little as possible;\nWhereas it is appropriate to retain part of the total HCFC placing on the market quota for allocation to importers in the Community who are not engaged in the production of HCFCs; whereas, in 1996, the level of imports by non-producers reached about 3% of the total quota available; whereas the 1997 level is likely to be similar; whereas it is therefore appropriate in 1998 to retain 4% of the total quota for allocation to importers who are not engaged in the production of HCFCs; whereas this corresponds to a quantity of 323 ODP tonnes;\nWhereas the HCFC placing on the market quota for each producer in the Community in 1998 shall reflect the market share which that producer reached in 1996, calculated in ODP tonnes; whereas it is appropriate to take 1996 as a base-year, which is the latest year for which data are available, in order to reflect most closely recent market activity by each producer; whereas it is considered appropriate to allocate the total available HCFC quantity of 7 756 ODP tonnes between producers without leaving a reserve;\nWhereas for methyl bromide the import quotas are allocated to the primary importers, considered by the Commission to be the importers who deal directly by way of invoicing with the producers outside the Community; whereas a reserve of 100,5 ODP tonnes of methyl bromide is retained for allocation during 1998 in accordance with the Article 16 procedure;\nWhereas import licences shall be issued by the Commission in accordance with Article 6 of the aforesaid Regulation, after verification of compliance by the importer with Articles 7, 8 and 12;\nWhereas the release for free circulation in the Community of chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and hydrobromofluorocarbons imported from any State not party is prohibited in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 16 of the same Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.
