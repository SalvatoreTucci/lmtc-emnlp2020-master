The two Sides intend to cooperate, with due regard to their respective competences, to consolidate and further develop the European Research Area, notably concerning research programming, training and mobility of researchers, research infrastructures, management of intellectual property and international collaboration. For this purpose, they may develop joint activities.\n2. The two Sides intend to cooperate, with due regard to their respective competences, in the following up and the implementation of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. For this purpose, they may develop joint activities.\n3. With due regard to their respective competences, institutional settings and operational frameworks, the two Sides will inform and consult each other, as appropriate, on issues of mutual interest, in particular in relation to the consolidation and further development of the European Research Area and to the European Strategy for Particle Physics, including, for the latter, related contacts with CERN non-Member States.\n4. Subject to its own procedures, the CERN Council will grant the Commission standing entitlement to attend its European Strategy Sessions and take the floor at these sessions.\n5. The observer status granted in 1985 to the European Communities at the CERN Council is maintained\u00a0(4).\n6. The Commission will grant CERN the right to propose candidates for membership of relevant expert and advisory bodies. These experts will be nominated by the Commission subject to its own rules and procedures.\n7. The two Sides will establish contact points and mechanisms for communication to reach the aim foreseen by the present Memorandum of Understanding.\n8. The two Sides will meet annually to take stock of progress and possibly discuss further ways to enhance mutual collaboration, including joint activities, or explore potential synergies.\n9. The two Sides will agree on the questions related to the interpretation and implementation of the present Memorandum of Understanding.\n10.
