Whereas it is appropriate to ensure that the rules and principles applied by third-country certifying officers provide guarantees which are at least equivalent to those laid down in this Directive;\n(14) Whereas Council Directive 93/119/EC(13) requires that the veterinary health certificate accompanying meat to be imported from third countries to the European Community must be supplemented by an attestation certifying that the animals have been slaughtered under conditions which offer guarantees of humane treatment at least equivalent to the relevant provisions in the Directive;\n(15) Whereas considering that a new certification regime is hereby established, a period of time should be provided for its implementation;\n(16) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision the following definitions shall be used:\n(a) \"fresh meat\": as defined in Article 2(a) of Council Directive 64/433/EEC(14);\n(b) \"de-boned fresh meat\": meat as described in paragraph (a) of this Article, together with diaphrams but excluding offal, from which the bone and the main accessible lymphatic glands have been removed.", "1.
