Regulation (EC) No 1232/2006 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.\n(4) In order to maintain a regular flow of imports, the quota period from 1 July to 30 June of the following year should be subdivided into a number of sub-periods. In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period.\n(5) The tariff quota should be administered on the basis of import licences. To that end, detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which must appear in applications and licences should be laid down.\n(6) In the light of the risk of speculation that is inherent in the system in question in the poultrymeat sector, precise conditions should be laid down as regards operators' access to the tariff quota arrangements.\n(7) For appropriate administration of the tariff quotas, the security linked to the import licences should be set at EUR 20 per 100 kilograms.\n(8) In the interest of the operators, the Commission should establish the quantities that have not been applied for, which are to be carried over to the following sub-period in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n(9) Access to the tariff quota should be subject to the presentation of a certificate of origin issued by the authorities of the United States in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(7).\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff quota in Annex I is hereby opened for imports of the poultrymeat products originating in the United States of America covered by the CN codes set out in that Annex.\nThe tariff quota is opened on an annual basis for the period from 1 July to 30 June.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of products covered by the quota referred to in paragraph 1, the applicable rate of customs duty and the order number are set out in Annex I.", "Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 and 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "The quantity established for the annual quota period shall be spread out over four sub-periods, as follows:\n(a) 25\u00a0% from 1 July to 30 September;\n(b) 25\u00a0% from 1 October to 31 December;\n(c) 25\u00a0% from 1 January to 31 March;\n(d) 25\u00a0% from 1 April to 30 June.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of applying Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, import licence applicants shall, when submitting their first application for a given quota period, furnish proof that they imported or exported, during each of the two periods referred to in that Article, at least 50 tonnes of products covered by Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications may be for several products covered by different CN codes and originating in the United States.
