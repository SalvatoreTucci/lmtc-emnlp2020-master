As a result, such provisions lead to divergent practices in the Member States and make it difficult to check whether the conditions relating to the duration of short stays for such third country nationals on the territory of the Member States are fulfilled, namely a maximum of three months in any six-month period.\n(3) At its meeting of 27 and 28 February 2003, the Council expressed support for the Commission's intention to clarify the existing rules in this area, notably by specifying, by way of a proposal for a Council Regulation the obligation for the Member States to stamp systematically third country nationals' travel documents on entry and exit at external border crossings.\n(4) In its Conclusions of 8 May 2003 the Council called for separate control lanes for different nationalities, differentiated by signs. Specific Community rules on local border traffic should improve the management of external borders by the services responsible, making it easier to overcome any practical difficulties arising from the requirement to stamp third country nationals' travel documents systematically. These measures will also help to ensure that any measures relaxing checks on persons at external borders are exceptional.\n(5) The obligation on the Member States to stamp third-country nationals' travel documents systematically when they enter the territory of the Member States provides, in conjunction with the limitation regarding the circumstances in which measures relaxing checks on persons at external borders may be adopted, the possibility of presuming, in the absence of a stamp on such travel documents, that their holder is not, or is no longer, respecting the conditions relating to the duration of a short stay.\n(6) However, it should be possible for the third country national concerned to overturn this presumption by any form of relevant and credible proof. In such cases, the competent national authorities should certify the date and the place of the relevant border crossing so as to provide the third country national concerned with evidence of the compliance with the conditions relating to the duration of the stay.\n(7) The stamping of the travel document makes it possible to establish, with certainty, the date and place of the crossing of the border, without establishing in all cases that all the required travel document control measures have been carried out.\n(8) This Regulation should also define the categories of persons whose documents do not have to be stamped systematically upon crossing the external borders of the Member States. In this context, it should be stressed that Community rules on local border traffic, including rules on the stamping of travel documents of border residents, are in the course of preparation. Pending the adoption of Community rules on local border traffic, the possibility of exempting the travel documents of border residents from the obligation of stamping should be maintained in accordance with existing bilateral agreements on local border traffic.\n(9) The provisions of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and the common manual should be amended accordingly.\n(10) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds on the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(11) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\u00a0(4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1(A) of Decision 1999/437/EC\u00a0(5) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.\n(12) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\u00a0(6), which fall in the area referred to in Article 1(A) of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4(1) of the Council Decisions of 25 October 2004 on the signing on behalf of the European Union, and on the signing on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions of that Agreement\u00a0(7).\n(13) This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\u00a0(8). The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(14) This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\u00a0(9). Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application,", "main_body": ["The purpose of this Regulation is:\n\u2014 to reiterate the obligation for the competent authorities of the Member States to stamp systematically third-country nationals' travel documents when they cross the external borders of the Member States;\n\u2014 to specify the conditions under which the absence of an entry stamp on third country nationals' travel documents may constitute a presumption that the authorised duration of a short stay by such nationals on the territory of the Member States has been exceeded.", "The provisions of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement are hereby amended as follows:\n1.
