The appropriateness of the detection method has been further analysed and recently confirmed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.\n(7) On the basis of the information recently provided to the Commission by the United States authorities a series of actions have been taken by Syngenta with the involvement of the United States Department of Agriculture to ensure that Bt10 will not be propagated in the company's germoplasm and/or distributed in the commercial production pathway.\n(8) Since the entry into force of Decision 2005/317/EC only one case of Bt10 entering Community territory has been registered, on 24 May 2005. A shipment of maize products contaminated by Bt10 left the United States before the availability of the analytical results of the testing and was notified by the importer prior to the arrival of the vessel to Ireland. The placing on the market of the contaminated products was thus prevented.\n(9) Apart from this specific case, no finding of Bt10 has been reported by Member States on the basis of the controls carried out by national competent authorities.\n(10) On the basis of this information it can be concluded that it is no longer necessary to keep in place the compulsory certification requirement. It is therefore appropriate to repeal Decision 2005/317/EC.\n(11) It is nevertheless appropriate that Member States keep monitoring, for a further period of six months, on the basis of a proper level of random testing, whether maize products contaminated by Bt 10 are still present on the market. Positive (unfavourable) results shall be rapidly communicated through the Rapid Alert System for food and feed in which case the Commission will evaluate whether further action is required.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/317/EC is repealed.", "For a further period of six months Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of random testing to verify the absence of the genetically modified maize Bt10 in the following products originating from the United States of America:\n\u2014 corn gluten feed containing or produced from genetically modified maize within CN code 2309\u00a090\u00a020,\n\u2014 brewers grains containing or produced from genetically modified maize within CN code 2303\u00a030\u00a000.\nPositive (unfavourable) results shall be rapidly communicated through the Rapid Alert System for food and feed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1.
