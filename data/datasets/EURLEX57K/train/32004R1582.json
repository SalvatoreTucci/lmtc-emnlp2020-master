Significant volumes of imports of CFL-i from Vietnam, Pakistan and the Philippines appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nFinally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for CFL-i originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questionnaires\n\n\n\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of information and holding of hearings\n\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exemption of registration of imports or measures\n\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REGISTRATION\n\nG\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\nIn the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n\u2014 producers in Vietnam, Pakistan and the Philippines may request exemption from registration of imports or measures,\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\n\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION", "main_body": ["An investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps with one or more glass tubes, with all lighting elements and electronic components fixed to the lamp foot or integrated in the lamp foot, falling within CN code ex\u00a08539\u00a031\u00a090 (TARIC code 85393190*91), consigned from Vietnam, Pakistan or the Philippines, whether declared as originating in Vietnam, Pakistan or the Philippines or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1470/2001 on imports of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps (CFL-i) originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps shall consist of one or more glass tubes, with all lighting elements and electronic components fixed to the lamp foot or integrated in the lamp foot.
