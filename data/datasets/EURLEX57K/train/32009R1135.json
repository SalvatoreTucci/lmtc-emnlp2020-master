To counter the health risk that may result from exposure to a high melamine content in feed and food products, Commission Decision 2008/798/EC of 14 October 2008 imposing special conditions governing the import of products containing milk or milk products originating in or consigned from China, and repealing Commission Decision 2008/757/EC\u00a0(2), provides for a prohibition on the importation into the Community of products containing milk or milk products, soya or soya products intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children, and requires Member States to perform systematic checks on all consignments originating in or consigned from China of feed and food containing milk, milk products, soya or soya products and of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed. In that Decision the level of 2,5\u00a0mg/kg was considered to be the appropriate level to distinguish between the unavoidable background presence of melamine and unacceptable adulteration.\n(3) The number of Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) notifications, as provided for in Article 2(4) of Decision 2008/798/EC, as regards unacceptable levels of melamine in those food and feed products from China has significantly decreased since January 2009, and the Chinese authorities have provided guarantees as regards the controls on melamine in such products exported to the Community. It is therefore appropriate to review the measures laid down in Decision 2008/798/EC.\n(4) Taking into account that products containing milk or milk products, soya or soya products that are intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children represent the primary, and in some cases sole, source of nourishment for infants and young children, it is appropriate to maintain the prohibition on importation into the Community of any such products originating from China. Member States should ensure that any such products found on the market are destroyed without delay.\n(5) At the same time, systematic checks on all consignments originating in or consigned from China of feed and food containing milk, milk products, soya or soya products and of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed are no longer necessary given the significant decrease in RASFF notifications, so the intensity of physical checks should be reduced. Since the level of 2,5\u00a0mg/kg continues to remain appropriate to distinguish between unavoidable background presence of melamine and unacceptable adulteration, products that contain a higher level of melamine should not enter the feed and food chain and should be safely disposed of.\n(6) Therefore, Decision 2008/798/EC should be amended accordingly. However, taking into account the nature of the amending provisions, it is appropriate to replace that Decision with a regulation, which could be reviewed at a later stage on the basis of the results of the controls carried out by the Member States.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation, references to China are to be understood as references to the People\u2019s Republic of China.", "Import prohibition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The import into the Community of products containing milk, milk products, soya or soya products intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children within the meaning of Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses\u00a0(3), originating or consigned from the People\u2019s Republic of China shall be prohibited.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that any such product found on the market shall be immediately withdrawn and destroyed.", "Prior notification\nFeed and food business operators or their representatives shall give prior notification to the control point referred to in Article 4(3) of the estimated date and time of arrival of all consignments originating in or consigned from China of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed and of feed and food containing milk, milk products, soya or soya products.", "Control measures\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authorities of the Member States shall carry out documentary, identity and physical checks, including laboratory analysis on the consignments originating in or consigned from China, which are to be imported into the Community, of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed and of feed and food containing milk, milk products, soya or soya products other than those referred to in Article 2(1).\nIdentity and physical checks, including sampling and analysis to control the presence of melamine, shall be carried out on approximately 20\u00a0% of such consignments.\nMember States may carry out random physical checks on other feed and food products with a high protein content originating from China, which are to be imported into the Community.\nThe physical checks referred to in this paragraph shall in particular aim at ascertaining the level of melamine, if any, in the product.
