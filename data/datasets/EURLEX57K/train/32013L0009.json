These measures shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility and shall apply, inter alia, to transportation. In accordance with Article 216(2) TFEU, agreements concluded by the Union are binding upon the institutions of the Union and on its Member States, and Directive 2008/57/EC \u2014 as an instrument of European Union secondary legislation \u2014 is subject to the obligations deriving from the Convention.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on rail passengers\u2019 rights and obligations\u00a0(3) states in recital 10 that disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility have the same right as all other citizens to free movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination and should have opportunities for rail travel comparable to those of other citizens. Article 21 of the Regulation requires railway undertakings and station managers to ensure, through compliance with the TSI for persons with reduced mobility, that stations, platforms, rolling stock and other facilities are accessible to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.\n(4) An adaptation of Annex III to Directive 2008/57/EC is necessary in order to include therein an explicit reference to accessibility. Accessibility is an essential requirement that is both a general requirement for the interoperability of the rail system and applies specifically to the infrastructure, rolling stock, operations and telematics applications for passengers\u2019 subsystems. Annex III to Directive 2008/57/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive do not in any way affect the principle of gradual implementation set out in Directive 2008/57/EC, notably that target subsystems indicated in a TSI may be obtained gradually within a reasonable timescale and that each TSI should indicate an implementation strategy in order to make a gradual transition from the existing situation to the final situation in which compliance with the TSI will be the norm.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are consistent with an approach to achieving access on an equal basis by applying technical solutions or operational measures or both.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 29(1) of Directive 2008/57/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 2008/57/EC, which sets out Essential Requirements, is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) the following paragraphs shall be added to Section 1:\n1.6.1.
