The cattle holdings, that in the next eight years must obtain an approval, correspond to 6 to 8 % of the national cattle herd.\n(7) Development of organic farming is a high priority for the Danish government. Organic cattle holdings allow only 140 kg nitrogen per hectare and reduce consequently nitrogen leaching of more than 10 %. Organic dairy farming in 1998 covers approximately 50000 livestock units corresponding to 5 % of the national cattle herd and the prognosis for 2003 is that organic dairy farming covers 130000 livestock units, equivalent to 15 % of the national cattle herd.\n(8) Denmark on 6 June 1997 notified legislation to the Commission in order to transpose the Directive into Danish law. Denmark on 2 July 1998 notified additional legislation to the Commission in order to implement fully the Directive. The legislation as notified is considered to be in compliance with the Directive. The provisions of that legislation apply equally to the notified derogation.\n(9) Action programmes are established with objectives for the aquatic environment to be attained through the appropriate associated reduction targets for nutrient discharges, i.e. elimination of point source farm-waste discharges and reduction of leaching losses to a level corresponding to an average of approximately 50 kg nitrogen per hectare annually which will ensure compliance with the objective of the Directive of a maximum of 50 mg/l of nitrates in groundwater.\n(10) Denmark's implementation of the Nitrates Directive is based on a stringent interpretation of the provisions of the Directive, in this context in particular the calculation of livestock units, nitrogen content of manure and the calculation of the acreage available for application of manure.\n(11) The Danish implementation of the Nitrates Directive is aimed at ensuring full achievement of the environmental objectives of the Directive as set out in Article 1.\n(12) The national monitoring program set up in agricultural areas contributes to the demonstration of the effect of the initiatives under the action programmes. The results will contribute to the basis for decision on additional measures or reinforced actions if it becomes apparent that the measures already taken are not sufficient for achieving the objective specified in Article 1 of the Directive.\n(13) The objective of the national monitoring programme is to demonstrate:\n- development in the agricultural contribution to water pollution,\n- relations between agricultural praxis and the discharge of nutrients to the environment,\n- reduction of the amount of nutrients in water leaving the root zone until it rejoins the watercourses,\n- development in the nutrient content in near-surface groundwater,\n- development in the agricultural use of nutrients,\n- size of and development in the agricultural field discharge.\n(14) The Danish action program for implementation of the Nitrates Directive includes a comprehensive set of general regulations setting standards for animal housing, manure containers, field application of livestock manure and fertiliser management. These regulations are based on acts and statutory orders.\n(15) As part of the implementation considering manure handling includes requests for animal houses built with appropriate drainage and collection of all manure and liquid waste, nine months storage capacity, tight floating cover on open liquid manure containers and limitations on manure spreading to certain times of the year. A control system has been set up by the municipalities to ensure compliance with these rules.\n(16) Each livestock holding must ensure a balance between agricultural land and number of livestock units corresponding to 170 kg nitrogen per hectare in animal manure (210 kg N/ha for cattle holdings) until 2002 and after 2002 the balance shall be equivalent to 140 kg N/ha (170 kg N/ha for cattle holdings). Acreage available for manure application excludes land that does not require fertilisation, land where livestock manure cannot be applied under normal conditions and land designated as set-aside acreage.\n(17) The nitrogen content of livestock manure is understood as the amount of total nitrogen in excreta minus volatile losses of ammonia in animal housing systems and during storage (10 % volatile losses being the maximum allowed for calculations).\n(18) As part of the implementation an increase in efficiency of utilisation of nitrogen content of manure (cattle slurry) from the present 60 % to a minimum of 65 % in the fertilisation year 2001/2002 is prescribed. A reduction of nitrogen fertilisation norms by 10 % below the economic optimum is prescribed, determined annually on the basis of numerous field trials.\n(19) All agricultural holdings must draw up crop rotation and fertilisation plans each year covering the period 1 August to 31 July. Such plans must be submitted to the competent authority. Such plans covering the period 1 August to 31 March the following year must be available to the authorities by 1 September at the latest. By 31 March such plans covering the whole of the period must be available. Crop rotation plans must specify green crops (catch crops, winter grain cereals and crops with a long growing season). Fertilisation plans must include the estimated need for nitrogen and phosphorous application according to the economic optimal and specifying the nature of fertiliser to be used (e.g. livestock manure, waste products, chemical fertiliser). Fertilisation plans must include a sketch map indicating location of individual fields. Such plans must be revised no later than seven days following any changes in agricultural practices to ensure consistency between plans and actual agricultural practices. These regulations are based on acts and statutory orders.\n(20) Fertilisation norms, crop nitrogen requirements and the relationship between these, in terms of permitted fertilisation, are stipulated in Statutory Orders.\n(21) Empirical models and calculations, presented in the Danish notification, based on amounts of manure and chemical fertiliser, crop type and soil type, show that a leaching of nitrate below 50 kg nitrogen per hectare annually could be reached with some complementary preventive measures on farming practices. The above models and calculations indicate that compliance with the objective of a maximum of 50 mg per litre of nitrates in groundwater at watershed level and considering denitrification is ensured.\n(22) Calculations presented by Denmark show the possibility of further reducing the amount of chemical fertiliser to ensure a higher efficiency of nitrogen uptake from applied manure in case monitoring shows a need for reduction of total nitrogen applied. Such further reduction of leaching shall ensure compliance with the above leaching target.\n(23) Maps showing the percentage of fields cultivated under this Decision will be presented every two years.\n(24) Results of representative monitoring from intensive cattle holdings in the approximately 1500 ha agricultural catchment monitoring program relevant to the situation covered by this Decision will be presented in order to show practical compliance with the conditions of this Decision.\n(25) This Decision is applicable within the framework of the Danish action programs adopted for the years 1999 to 2003.\n(26) The Commission, having examined the justification of Denmark's request, is satisfied that the amount fixed and the conditions for its application will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of the Directive, as specified in Article 1.\n(27) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of 6 December 2001 of the Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["Denmark's request submitted by letter of 2 July 1998 asking the Commission to allow derogation under paragraph 2(b) of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC is approved, subject to the conditions laid down hereunder.", "Definitions\n- \"Cattle farms\" means holdings with more than three livestock units, where at least two-thirds of livestock are cattle,\n- \"grass\" means permanent or temporary grassland (generally temporary lies less than four years),\n- \"crops being undersown by grass\": silage cereals, silage maize and/or spring barley, to be undersown before (maize) or after harvest, by grass which will act as a catch crop, for biological retention of nitrogen residual during winter,\n- \"beets\" means forage beets.", "Scope\nThis derogation applies, on an individual basis, to cattle farms where the crop rotation includes more than 70 % of particularly nitrogen consuming crops, with a long growing season.
