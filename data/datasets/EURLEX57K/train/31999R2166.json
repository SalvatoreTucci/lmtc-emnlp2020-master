Reimbursements refer to payments to households by government units, social security administrations or non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs), that are made as direct consequences of purchases of individually specified goods and services, initially paid for by households.\n2. Payments of claims to households by insurance companies do not constitute reimbursements.\n3. Other payments or rebates to households by government units, social security administrations or NPISHs in the form of assistance to reduce household expenditure, such as housing allowances to tenants or payments due to sickness, disability, the care of elderly relatives or scholarships to students, are considered as social benefits in cash. They are treated as income transfers to households and do not constitute reimbursements.", "Coverage\n1. Goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors on which household final monetary consumption expenditure is incurred shall be covered in the HICP and grouped in accordance with the COICOP/HICP categories as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2214/96.\n2. All providers of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors, such as government and private institutions, NPISHs or private self-employed persons, shall be covered in the HICP independently of their status. This excludes individuals or groups of individuals as producers of goods and non-financial services exclusively for own final use.\n3. In accordance with COICOP/HICP, Education (Division 10) includes education services only. If an all-inclusive price is charged for education services in combination with educational materials or education support services, its components shall be separated and allocated to the COICOP/HICP classes concerned. Where such an all-inclusive price cannot be separated into the prices of the components concerned, the all-inclusive price shall be allocated to COICOP/HICP Division 10.\n4. Borderline cases between education services at the pre-primary level and child-minding social protection facilities, such as wet-nurses, cr\u0102\u00a8ches and play-schools, shall be allocated to COICOP/HICP Division 10 if the child's age of entry is not less than three years and the activities consist of organised instruction in a school-type environment designed to bridge the gap between the home and school atmosphere. If, on the other hand, the main objective is not a pedagogical one, but to provide child-minding assistance and support, the service concerned should be allocated to COICOP/HICP class 12.4.0.\n5. Where hospitals, in addition to basic services as defined in COICOP/HICP 06.3, make other goods or services available to in-patients on a separate charge basis, the latter shall not be allocated to class 06.3.0, but to the COICOP/HICP classes concerned.", "Prices\n1. The HICP sub-indices concerned shall be calculated using a formula which is consistent with the Laspeyres-type formula used for other sub-indices. They should reflect the price change on the basis of the changed expenditure of maintaining the consumption pattern of households and the composition of the consumer population in the base or reference period.\n2. (a) The purchaser prices of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors to be used in the HICP shall be the amounts to be paid by consumers net of reimbursements.\n(b) Changes in purchaser prices which reflect changes in the rules determining them shall be shown as price changes in the HICP.\n(c) Where purchaser prices are index-linked, changes resulting from changes in the index shall be shown as price changes in the HICP.\n(d) Changes in the purchaser prices resulting from changes in purchasers' incomes shall be shown as price changes in the HICP.\n3. Where quality changes, prices should be treated according to the rules applied in the context of specification changes, and in particular those regarding quality adjustment pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96.\n4. Where goods or services, in the health, education and social protection sectors, have been made available to consumers free of charge and subsequently an actual price is charged, the change from zero to an actual price, and vice versa, shall be reflected in the HICP.\n5. Where goods or services in the health, education and social protection sectors, jointly provided with other goods and services, have been made available to consumers free of charge and subsequently are charged for on a separate basis, the change shall be reflected in the HICP.\n6. Where relevant, the procedure provided for in Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2646/98(6) concerning tariffs shall apply mutatis mutandis.", "Basic information\nThe basic information shall be all purchaser prices of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors and their components, together with weightings which reflect the level, the timing and the structure of the consumption of such goods or services, according to the price-determining socioeconomic characteristics.", "Data sources\n1. The HICP sub-indices concerned shall be computed by the Member States from basic information as defined in Article 5.\n2. The statistical units, such as government agencies, social security administrations or NPISHs, called upon by the Member States to cooperate in the collection or provision of basic information are obliged to give honest and complete information at the time it is requested and allow the organisations and institutions responsible for compiling official statistics, on request, to obtain information at the level of detail necessary to evaluate compliance with the comparability requirements and the quality of the HICP sub-indices.", "Comparability\nHICPs constructed following the procedures described in Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation or following other procedures which do not result in an index which differs systematically by more than one tenth of one percentage point on average over one year against the previous year from an index compiled following those procedures, shall be deemed comparable.", "Quality control\n1.
