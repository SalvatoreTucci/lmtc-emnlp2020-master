It refers to the five years prior to the date of the interview.\nNext six months (for the variables related to \u2018risk of changing the dwelling\u2019). It refers to the six months succeeding to the date of the interview.\nCurrent (for all other variables).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Definitions\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dwelling installations and facilities\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Electrical installations: wiring, contacts, sockets and other permanent electrical installations in the dwelling.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plumbing/water installations: pipes, taps, drainage and outlets.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Central heating or similar: a housing unit is considered \u2018centrally heated\u2019 if heating is provided either from a community heating centre or from an installation built in the building or in the housing unit, established for heating purposes, without attention paid to the source of energy. Fixed electrical radiators, fixed gas heaters and similar are included. The heating shall be available in most rooms.\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other fixed heating: a housing unit is considered heated by \u2018other fixed heating\u2019 when the heating is not considered as \u2018central heating/or similar\u2019. It includes stoves, heaters, fireplaces and similar (\u2018fixed\u2019 air conditioning appliances used as a heating facility included).\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other non-fixed heating: no fixed heating system or heating device. The dwelling could however be equipped with portable heating, including portable air conditioning appliances used as a heating facility.\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adequate: sufficient to satisfy the general requirements/needs of the household. An installation which is permanently out of order is considered as no installation. Inadequate installations can be: installations in bad condition, dangerous installations, installations which are regularly out of order, where there is not enough electrical power/pressure for the water to be used, the water is not drinkable, or there is limited availability. Minor temporary problems such as a blockage in the outlet do not mean that the installation is inadequate.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accessibility of basic needs\n(a) Accessibility: this shall relate to the services used by the household having regard to the financial, physical, technical and health conditions.\n(b) Accessibility of services is to be assessed in terms of physical and technical access, and opening hours, but not in terms of quality, price and similar aspects. Consequently, the access should refer to an objective and physical reality. It should not be based on a subjective feeling.\n(c) The access should be determined in relation to the services actually used by the household. If the household does not use the service, flag -2 \u2018Not applicable\u2019 should be used.\n(d) The physical access has to be assessed in terms of distance but also of infrastructure and equipment for example for respondents with a physical disability.\n(e) Accessibility in terms of phone-banking and PC-banking should also be part of the assessment, if these ways are actually used by the household.\n(f) The services provided at home should also be taken into account, if they are actually used by the household. The accessibility has thus to be evaluated regardless the way(s) the household access to the service.\n(g) The accessibility should be considered at the level of the household, the difficulty to access has to be evaluated for the household as a whole. If the respondent doesn't use a service but other household member(s) do, the respondent should assess the accessibility according to this (these) other household member(s).\n(h) If one member of the household has a disability, but if another member can access easily to the service for him/her and the access to the service does not cause any problems for the household in the sense that it doesn't represent any burden for the household, then the service would be considered as easily accessible by the household.\n(i) On the other hand, if one member of the household has a disability and can hardly access a service (which he needs as an individual) and the household has no resource available to provide him support (e.g. if no other member can access easily to the service for him/her), or really represents a burden for the household, in this case the access to the service would be considered as difficult for the household.\n(j) Grocery services: services which can provide most of the daily needs.\n(k) Banking services: withdraw cash, transfer money and pay bills.\n(l) Postal services: send and receive ordinary and parcel post.\n(m) Public transport: bus, metro, tram and similar.\n(n) Primary health care services: general practitioner, primary health centre or similar.\n(o) Compulsory schools: if more than one child in the household is in compulsory school the respondent should refer to the one with the most difficulty.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data transmission\nThe target secondary variables should be sent to Eurostat in the Household Data file (H-file) and in the Personal Data File (P-file) after the target primary variables.\nAREAS AND LIST OF TARGET VARIABLES\nModule 2012 Housing conditions\nVariable name Code Target variable\nITEMS ASKED AT HOUSEHOLD
