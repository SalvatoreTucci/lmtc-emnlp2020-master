It therefore decides to extend the period of application of its Decision 2011/492/EU by 12 months until 19 July 2013.\nThe European Union recalls the Council Conclusions on the Republic of Guinea-Bissau adopted on 23 April 2012, underlines once again the importance that it attaches to future cooperation with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and confirms its willingness to, pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2048 (2012) of 18 May 2012, accompany the Republic of Guinea-Bissau towards the restoration of constitutional order and a situation where the resumption of full cooperation becomes possible.\nThe European Union supports the concerted efforts of international partners to restore stability, democracy and respect for human rights in the Republic of Guinea Bissau.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
