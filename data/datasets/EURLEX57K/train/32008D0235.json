In its Recommendation of 25 May 2005, the Commission stated its intention to consider proposing the establishment of such an external advisory body.\n(4) On 8 November 2005, the Council concluded that a new high-level advisory body would enhance the independence, integrity and accountability of the Commission (Eurostat) and, in the context of the peer review assessment of implementing the Code of Practice, of the European Statistical System. The Council recommended that the body should be a small group of independent persons appointed on the basis of their competence.\n(5) The members of that body should provide a complementary mix of skills and experience, drawing, for example, on people from academia and those with national and/or international professional experience in the field of statistics.\n(6) The body should establish an assessment for the Commission (Eurostat) on the implementation of the Code of Practice analogous to the peer review of National Statistical Offices.\n(7) A dialogue with the Statistical Programme Committee and the European Statistical Advisory Committee, established by Decision No 234/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), on the Code of Practice, and also with Member States\u2019 stakeholder bodies, should be encouraged where appropriate.\n(8) An advisory board should therefore be established, and its tasks and structure defined, without prejudice to Article 5 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank,", "main_body": ["Advisory Board\nThe European Statistical Governance Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board) is hereby established.
