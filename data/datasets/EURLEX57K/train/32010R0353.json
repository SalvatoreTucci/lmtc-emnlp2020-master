Some other amendments have been made, in particular as regards the proof of origin and the labelling.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified.

The fresh mirabelles are for direct consumption or processing. The deep-frozen mirabelles are for processing or retail sale and come in different forms:\n(a) whole, with stone in;\n(b) whole, with stone removed; and\n(c) in halves, with stone removed.\u2019\n(2) The description of the product is more specific as to the various possible uses of the fruit and the ways in which it may be presented.\n(3) The following paragraph is added: \u2018The characteristics of each category of the product must comply with the respective rules in force.\u2019\n(4) The following table laying down the physical and chemical characteristics of the product is added:\n\u2018Mirabelles de Lorraine\u2019\nCharacteristics Fruits \u2265 22 mm in diameter\nProof of origin\n(1) The sentence \u2018For each consignment, the member companies record in a register the holding where the fruit was produced, the quantity, the type of packaging and the end use\u2019 is replaced by \u2018For each consignment, the member companies put in place upstream and downstream traceability arrangements whereby origin, quantity, type of packaging and end use can be identified.\u2019\n(2) The following points are deleted:\n(a) \u2018the declarations of printing and use of aerex crates, banners, labels or vignettes referring to the designation;\n(b) copy of the members' stock accounts for identifying labels, banners and vignettes.\u2019\n(3) The following paragraphs are added:\n(a) \u2018After packaging, each package of fruit for direct consumption or pallet of fruit for processing has a unique code linking to information about previous stages of handling (this code may correspond to the number of the production or pallet record).\n(b) On consignment, the date of consignment and name of the customer are entered in the production record.\u2019\nMethod of production\n(1) The following is added to make the reference to the types of soil more precise: \u201845\u00a0% of fine elements of less than 20 microns (clay plus fine silt).\u2019\n(2) The following part of paragraph 4.4.2 is deleted: \u2018the climate probably has an influence on the quality of the product; the link between soil, climate and quality is currently the subject of an AREFE study: 20 orchards have been studied for the past 6 years and the conclusions of the study will be published in three years' time.\u2019\n(3) The references to the provisions of the regional orchard replanting specifications are deleted.\n(4) The reference to the analysis of leaves in the autumn is deleted.\n(5) The reference to minimum planting densities of 150 trees per hectare is deleted.\n(6) The criteria for analysing the degree of ripeness are amended.\n(7) Reference is made to the AREFE scale rather than the Hunter A scale.\n(8) The reference to a sugar to acidity ratio of 4 or more is replaced by the minimum sugar content figure of 15\u00b0 Brix.\n(9) The following explanations of cumulative temperatures are added: \u2018Minimum cumulative temperatures at the F2 stage of 1\u00a0750\u00a0\u00b0C (Annex 6: ripeness guide): From the point at which 50\u00a0% of the flowers are open, a cumulative count is kept of each day's average temperature. It has been shown that the Mirabelle 1510 variety is ripe at around 1\u00a0850\u00a0\u00b0C. The early strains are ripe at around 1\u00a0750\u00a0\u00b0C.\u2019\n(10) The following paragraph on deep-freezing is added: \u2018The deep-freezing technique involves creating an intense heat exchange whereby the maximum temperature is reduced very rapidly to \u2013\u00a018\u00a0\u00b0C; this differentiates it from simple freezing. The more rapid the exchange, the better are the organoleptic properties of the product. This method of conservation preserves the quality and organoleptic characteristics of the mirabelles. Deep-freezing has certain advantages, such as:\n(a) organoleptic advantages (appearance, consistency, flavour): of all the conservation processes, this cold treatment is the only one that is capable of restoring all the organoleptic qualities of the produce as captured in its fresh state;\n(b) nutritional advantages: deep-freezing in itself has no impact on the nutritional value. The cold stabilises the state of the product;\n(c) microbiological advantages: below \u2013\u00a018\u00a0\u00b0C, micro-organisms no longer develop. Their proliferation is also prevented by the total absence of water (which quickly turns to ice).\u2019\n(11) The sentence \u2018This area corresponds to the stages in which the fruit is produced, stored before packaging and then packaged\u2019 is replaced by \u2018For the fresh fruit, all operations (production, sorting, sizing, packaging) are carried out in the geographical area. For the deep-frozen fruit, the following stages take place in the geographical area: production, sorting, sizing, stoning, deep-freezing.\u2019\nLabelling\nThe section on labelling is brought into line with regulatory developments.\nOther\nAs regards the name and composition of the group:\nAIAL is now AMDL.\nThe name of the president of the association is removed.\nThe names of the member companies are removed.\nText is added on the purpose and functioning of the association.\nMore detail is added, on the basis of the association's statute, as regards its functioning and its role in promoting quality.\nThe class designation is updated in line with Regulation (EC) No 1898/2006.\nANNEX II\nSINGLE DOCUMENT\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin\n\u2018MIRABELLES DE LORRAINE\u2019\nEC No: FR-PGI-0117-0194-10.12.2007\nPGI (X)\u00a0PDO (\u00a0)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2018Mirabelles de Lorraine\u2019\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member state or third country\nFrance\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the agricultural product or foodstuff\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of product\nClass 1.6.

It is characterised by clay-limestone (magnesium-potassium) soils. The Lorraine mirabelle orchards are planted on soil with 45\u00a0% of fine elements of less than 20 microns (clay plus fine silt).\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2018Mirabelles de Lorraine\u2019 are the product of two local varieties, \u2018Mirabelles de Nancy\u2019 and \u2018Mirabelles de Metz\u2019.\nThe specificity of \u2018Mirabelles de Lorraine\u2019\u2019 is linked to the method of training: for the best possible development of the fruit, the planting density in the orchards may not exceed 400 trees per hectare, the fruit is picked at the best stage of ripeness and within a short period (around six weeks from the beginning of August to mid-September). The aim is to produce a yellow, sweet fruit unlike the green, sour mirabelles found in other regions.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe link with the geographical origin derives from the product's reputation. This, in turn, is based on the prominence of the \u2018Mirabelle de Lorraine\u2019 in local gastronomy and reflected in literature, in particular through historical references from the 16th century.\nAlso, traditional festivals that are still held today testify to the recognition enjoyed by the product among consumers. Lorraine is responsible for 70 to 80\u00a0% of France's production of fresh mirabelles.\nThe traditional forms of processing, to produce jam, baked goods and canned fruit, account for a significant part of the activity in the sector. The myriad of local recipes calling for mirabelles testifies to their use in these traditional forms, apart from being eaten fresh.\nReference to publication of the specification\nhttp://www.inao.gouv.fr/repository/editeur/pdf/CDC-IGP/CDC-mirabelle-de-Lorraine.pdf"}
