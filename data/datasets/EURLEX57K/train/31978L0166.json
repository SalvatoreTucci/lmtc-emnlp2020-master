In order that results may be promptly available, the data to be supplied by undertakings may be collected on a representative basis. The statistical unit for these statistics shall be the unit of economic activity as defined in Part I of NACE.\nFor the purposes of the Communities' requirements, presentation of the data shall be based on NACE.

Number of permits granted for residential buildings with an indication of the number of dwellings and the habitable floor space and/or volume to be constructed,\n1.2. Number of permits granted for non-residential buildings, with an indication of the number of buildings and the useful floor space and/or the volume to be constructed;\n2. Index-numbers of industrial production:        2.1. Index of production for building and civil engineering:          2.1.1. Index of production for building,\n2.1.2.

Orders received for building, in value ; or value of residential and non-residential buildings started,\n3.1.2.

Number of employees, specifying the number of manual workers;\n5.  Gross wages and salaries;\n6.  Volume of work done:      6.1. Number of hours worked in building,\n6.2. Number of hours worked in civil engineering.", "1. The data shall be collected for the first time not later than in the fourth quarter after the notification of this Directive and shall be in respect of the preceding month or quarter.\n2. Member States which do not have statistics on building permits (variable 1) and in which the administrative system is not appropriate for the establishing of such statistics shall be exempted from supplying data relating to that variable.\nMember States which do not have statistics on volume of work done (variable 6) or for which the number of hours worked is not a reliable indicator of the volume of work done due to the structure of employment in building and civil engineering, shall be exempted from supplying data relating to that variable.\n3. Member States shall have a period of two years from the date of the notification of this Directive in which to supply data on the total index of production for building and civil engineering (variable 2.1).\n4. Member States shall have a period of four years from the date of the notification of this Directive in which to    - break down the total index of production (variable 2.1) into an index of production for building (variable 2.1.1) amd an index of production for civil engineering (variable 2.1.2),\n- supply data on the total index of orders for building and civil engineering (variable 3.1) and value data on orders received in civil engineering (variable 3.1.2),\n- supply data on the number of manual workers as distinct from data on the number of employees (variable 4).\n5.
