On release for consumption the meat has the following characteristics:\ncolour: light pink with white fat cover;\ntexture: fine texture;\nconsistency: solid, lightly marbled with fat.\nRelease for consumption can be of the whole carcase or in the following other cuts: whole; half-carcase (obtained by sagittal sectioning); spalla (shoulder); leg; chops; head and pluck (heart, lungs and liver).\nCarcases must display the following features on slaughter: cold weight, without skin, with head and pluck: 8\u00a0kg maximum; colour of flesh: light pink (particular emphasis is put on the internal muscles of the abdominal wall); consistency of muscular masses: solid (absence of serosity); colour of fat: white; consistency of fat: solid (with particular emphasis on the fat mass above the point of attachment of the tail, at 18\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C ambient temperature); fat cover: moderate over the external surface of the carcase but not excessive over the kidneys.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nThis is the meat and parts of male and female lambs of the most widespread genetic types to be found in the delimited area, i.e. the Sarda, Comisana, Sopravvissana, Massese and Merinizzata Italiana breeds and crosses. The lambs are slaughtered at between 28 and 40 days old, up to 8\u00a0kg dead weight. Furthermore, the animals intended for the production of the PGI \u2018Abbacchio Romano\u2019 must be identified within 20 days of birth by a tag or button affixed to the left ear, the front of which shows the identification code of the holding in letters and figures and the back the lamb\u2019s serial number.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\nThe lambs must be fed with their mothers\u2019 milk (natural suckling). Supplementary grazing on natural foods and wild plants is permitted.\nThe mother ewes graze on the natural and sown pasture and meadow land typical of the production zone (point 4). Dried fodder and concentrates are also permitted, but synthetic substances and genetically modified organisms are not.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe lambs must be born, raised and slaughtered in the Region of Lazio.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules on slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2014\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe product must be released for consumption bearing the specific logo in order to identify it and guarantee its origin.\nMarking must be carried out at the abattoir. The meat is displayed for the sale in the cuts described in point 3.2.\nIn addition to the Community graphic symbol and indications and the information required by law, the packaging must carry on the label the following indications in clear and legible print:\n\u2014 the name \u2018Abbacchio Romano\u2019 must appear in clear indelible letters that are significantly larger than and markedly different from all other writing. It must be followed by \u2018Indicazione Geografica Protetta\u2019 and/or \u2018IGP\u2019,\n\u2014 the logo must be impressed on the carcase surface so that it lies on the outward side of the cuts,\n\u2014 the logo takes the form of a square made up of three coloured lines, green, white and red, interrupted above by a wavy red line linked to a red oval within the square containing a stylised lamb\u2019s head. The square is interrupted below by the red capital letters \u2018IGP\u2019. Within the lower part of the square are the words \u2018Abbachio\u2019 in yellow capitals and \u2018Romano\u2019 in red capitals.\nThe name \u2018Abbacchio Romano\u2019 must be in Italian.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe entire territory of the Region of Lazio.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe soil and climate characteristics of the entire Region of Lazio provide optimum conditions for rearing sheep without causing stress to the animals. The region has various types of relief, such as limestone mountains, volcanic mountains, hills and alluvial plains, an annual average temperature of 13\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 16\u00a0\u00b0C and annual rainfall of at least 650\u00a0mm along the coastal strip, 1\u00a0000-1\u00a0500\u00a0mm on the inland plains and up to 1\u00a0800-2\u00a0000\u00a0mm on the Terminillo and in the Simbruini mountain range.\nThe lambs are reared in the free-range and semi-free range and are fed with their mothers\u2019 milk. The mother ewes graze on the natural and sown pasture and meadow land typical of the production zone (point 4). The lambs and ewes are not subjected to forced feeding, environmental stress or hormonal treatment designed to boost production; traditional mountain grazing in the summer is permitted.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe meat is distinguished by its light pink colour and white fat cover; fine texture; solid consistency, lightly marbled with fat. These characteristics have made \u2018Abbacchio Romano\u2019 so well known in the regional gastronomy that it plays a fundamental role in the cooking of Rome and the Region of Lazio and has spawned about a hundred different dishes.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe \u2018Abbacchio Romano\u2019 has had, since time immemorial, a strong link with the region\u2019s countryside, which is proven not only by the importance of sheep raising for the economy and traditions of the Region of Lazio as a whole but also and above all by its long-standing reputation with consumers. The natural and sown pasture land confers distinctive qualities on the milk of the mother ewes that the lambs feed on, the synergy being exceptionally favourable for both the quality and also the uniformity of the characteristics of the meat. The PGI product has such a considerable impact on the regional gastronomy and plays such a fundamental role in the cooking of Rome and the Region of Lazio that it is the basis of approximately a hundred different dishes. At social level, the link between the product and the geographical area is proven by the numerous rural festivals, feasts and shows in the Region of Lazio that are centred on the \u2018Abbacchio Romano\u2019. It is worth noting that the Roman word \u2018abbacchio\u2019 is used uniformly in the Region of Lazio. As a matter of fact, according to the Chiappino Dictionary of Roman dialect, the term \u2018abbacchio\u2019 refers to a suckling lamb or a lamb that has recently stopped suckling and \u2018agnello\u2019 a lamb of almost one year of age that has been shorn twice already. In Florence both are called \u2018agnello\u2019 (lamb). Roman terms such as \u2018sbacchiattura\u2019 and \u2018abbacchiatura\u2019 (slaughter of such animals) are also used for a number of operations carried out on the \u2018abbacchio\u2019.\nReference to publication of the specification\nhttp://www.politicheagricole.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/3335\nby going directly to the home page of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy (www.politicheagricole.it) and clicking on \u2018Qualit\u00e0 e sicurezza\u2019 (in the top right-hand corner of the screen) and then on \u2018Disciplinari di Produzione all\u2019esame dell\u2019UE\u2019."}
