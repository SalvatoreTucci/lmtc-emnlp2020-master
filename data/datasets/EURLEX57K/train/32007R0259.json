Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position. Therefore, refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2805/95\u00a0(2) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wines,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2805/95 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 16 March 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nJean-Luc DEMARTY\nDirector-General for Agriculture and Rural Development\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
