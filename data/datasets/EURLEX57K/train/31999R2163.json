Those areas are defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 of 11 April 1986 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goat meat is granted(4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3519/86(5).\n(2) Pursuant to Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 and to enable an advance payment to be made to sheep meat and goat meat producers, the foreseeable loss of income should be estimated in the light of the foreseeable trend in market prices.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the amount of the premium per ewe for producers of heavy lambs is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of that Article by a coefficient expressing the annual average production of heavy lamb meat per ewe producing these lambs expressed per 100 kg of carcase weight. The coefficient for 1999 has not yet been fixed in view of the lack of full Community statistics. Pending the fixing of that coefficient, a provisional coefficient should be used. Article 5(3) of that Regulation also fixes the amount per ewe for producers of light lambs and per female of the caprine species at 80 % of the premium per ewe for producers of heavy lambs.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the premium must be reduced by the impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in paragraph 2 of that Article. That coefficient is fixed by Article 13(4) at 7 %.\n(5) In accordance with Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the half-yearly advance payment is fixed at 30 % of the expected premium. In accordance with Article 4(3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2700/93(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1410/1999(7), the advance payment is to be paid only if it is equal to or greater than EUR 1.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 provides for the application of specific measures relating to agricultural production in the Canary Islands. Those measures entail the grant of a supplement to the ewe premium to producers of light lambs and she-goats on the same conditions as those governing the grant of the premium referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98. Those conditions provide that Spain is authorised to pay an advance on the said supplementary premium.\n(7) For budgetary reasons, the second advance to the premium may not be paid before 16 October 1999.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["The difference, which is hereby estimated between the basic price, reduced by the impact of the coefficient laid down in Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, and the foreseeable market price for 1999, is EUR 143,785 per 100 kg.", "1. The estimated amount of the premium payable per ewe is as follows:\n- producers of heavy lambs: EUR 22,545,\n- producers of light lambs: EUR 18,036.\n2.
