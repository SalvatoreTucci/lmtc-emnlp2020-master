The planning of the measures for the development and rationalization of aquaculture production corresponding to the investments provided for in the Annex hereto shall be carried out with due regard for the priorities set by the various  Regulations governing the Community structural policies.\n2.

Preference shall be given to investment projects to which the Member State applies rules favourable to the development of aquaculture.\n4. Preference shall be given to innovative projects based on adequate research work and ensuring in the long term the diversification of production.\n5.

Collective investments are planned for the development of shellfish beds and the joint purchase by producers of dredgers for collecting molluscs, and for projects combining production with the  raising of health and/or environmental standards.\nThere is a need to explore the scope for funding working capital in shellfish farming.\nMarket\nThe current outlook for the development of the salmon market suggests a firming in price as the demand/supply ratio improves up to 1996 while production costs should continue to reduce.\nThe forecasts for the development of mollusc production are satisfactory but an integrated approach should be taken to marketing.\nThe costs engendered by Ireland's remoteness can be reduced by increasing its integration within the single market.\nPriorities/objectives\nAquaculture development must take place with due regard for the environment and in the light of the market trends of the species being farmed. The objectives are to:\n- improve productivity (better management of production costs),\n- expand production to include new species,\n- promote employment,\n- reduce disease incidence,\n- achieve self-sufficiency in the supply of mollusc seed and balance in smolt production,\n- meet the demand for raw material created by the growth of the processing sector."}
