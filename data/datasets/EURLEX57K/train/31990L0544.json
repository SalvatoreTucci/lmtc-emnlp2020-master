whereas that choice is in accordance with the provisions of the International  Telecommunications Union (ITU) Radio Regulations;\nWhereas CEPT Recommendation T/R 25-07 on the coordination of frequencies for the European Radio  Messaging System has designated the European channels for the ERMES system;\nWhereas parts of the frequency band are being used or are intended for use by certain Member  States for other radio services;\nWhereas the progressive availability of the requisite part of the frequency band set out above  will be indispensable for the establishment of a truly pan-European radio paging service;\nWhereas some flexibility will be needed in order to take account of different frequency  requirements in different Member States; whereas it will be necessary to ensure that such  flexibility does not slow down the expansion of a pan-European system;\nWhereas coordination procedures will have to be established between neighbouring countries as  required;\nWhereas the implementation of Council Recommendation 90/543/EEC of 9 October 1990 on the  coordinated introduction of pan-European land-based public radio paging in the Community  (5) will  ensure the start of a pan-European system by 31 December 1992 at the latest;\nWhereas on the basis of present technological and market trends, it appears realistic to envisage  the designation of the 169,4 - 169,8 MHz frequency band as the band from which frequencies are  selected in accordance with commercial requirements for the implementation and expansion of a  pan-European radio paging system;\nWhereas Council Directive 86/361/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the initial stage of the mutual  recognition of type approval for telecommunications terminal equipment  (6) will allow the rapid  establishment of common conformity specifications for the pan-European land-based public radio  paging system;\nWhereas the report on public mobile communication drawn up by the Analysis and Forecasting Group  (GAP) for the Senior Officials Group for Telecommunications (SOG-T) strongly recommends that  telecommunications administrations reach an agreement to use the same radio frequencies for radio  paging;\nWhereas favourable opinions on this report have been delivered by the telecommunications  administrations, by CEPT and by telecommunications equipment manufacturers in the Member States;\nWhereas radio paging is a particularly spectrum-efficient communications method for alerting  and/or sending messages to users on the move,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Directive,  'pan-European land-based public radio paging service shall mean a public radio paging service based  on a terrestrial infrastructure in the Member States in accordance with a common specification  which allows persons wishing to do so to send and/or to receive alert and/or numeric or  alphanumeric messages anywhere within the coverage of the service in the Community.", "1.   Member States shall, in accordance with CEPT Recommendation T/R 25-07 designate in the 169,4 to  169,8 MHz waveband four channels which shall have priority and be protected, and preferably be:\n-  169,6  MHz,\n-  169,65  MHz,\n-  169,7  MHz,\n-  169,75  MHz,\nfor the pan-European land-based public radio paging service by 31 December 1992 at the latest.\n2.  Member States shall ensure that plans are prepared as quickly as possible to enable the  pan-European public radio paging service to occupy the whole of the band 169,4 to 169,8 MHz  according to commercial demand.", "1.  Member States shall bring into force the laws,  regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive no later than 18  October 1991. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\n2.  Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law  which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.", "The Commission shall report  to the Council on the implementation of this Directive not later than the end of 1996.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 9 October  1990.
