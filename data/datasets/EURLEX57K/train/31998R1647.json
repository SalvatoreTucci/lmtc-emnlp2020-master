In the case of short-duration programmes in accordance with Article 15(1) of this Regulation giving rise to an undertaking to present programmes of normal duration, such costs may be eligible for five years.\n2. Overheads including in particular:\n- management costs,\n- personnel costs; however, personnel costs are not considered as overheads if resulting from measures to improve or maintain a high level of quality, marketing or environmental protection, implementation of which essentially involves the use of qualified personnel; if, in such cases, the producer organisation uses its own employees or member producers, the time worked must be documented by time sheets,\n- the costs involved in preparing the operational programme and monitoring its implementation,\n- the cost of preparing the annual reports, final report and the evaluation study referred to in Article 11,\n- the costs of keeping accounts and the separate bank account referred to in Article 4(3)(b).\nThese expenses are met by means of the payment of a lump sum equal to 2 % of the operational fund and up to a maximum of ECU 60 000. However, the Member States may restrict funding to the real costs, in which case they should define the eligible costs.\n3. Income or price supplements.\n4. Insurance costs including individual or group insurance premiums and the creation of insurance funds within a producer organisation.\n5. Reimbursement (especially in the form of annual payments) of loans taken out for an operation carried out in full or in part before the beginning of the operational programme.\n6.

Investment in means of transport to be used for marketing or distribution trips by the producer organisation, except for such investments relating to cold-storage or controlled-atmosphere transport.\n12.

Promotion of individual commercial labels; generic promotion and/or promotion of collective labels is not eligible where geographical names other than those covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 (3) are used on publicity, except where these are secondary to the principal message and are not reserved for the use of the producer organisation concerned.\n15. Subcontracting contracts relating to the operations or expenditure mentioned in this list.\n16. Taxes and other national charges, except for charges linked to wages.\n(1) The competent national authority must lay down the eligibility criteria for an experimental/pilot operation taking account of the newness of the procedure or concept and the risk involved.\n(2) The competent national authority should set additional conditions for the acceptance of this type of expenditure in order to avoid all speculation; these conditions may include in particular forbidding the sale of the investment/land during a minimum period and the setting of a maximum correlation between the value of the land and the value of the investment.\n(3) OJ L 208, 24. 7. 1992, p. 1."}
