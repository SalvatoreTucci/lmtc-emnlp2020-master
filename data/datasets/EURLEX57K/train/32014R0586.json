Therefore, the fishery cannot be undertaken with other gears.\n(15) The management plan guarantees no future increase in the fishing effort, as fishing authorisations will be issued only to specified 36 vessels involving a total effort of 1\u00a0745 kW that are already authorised to fish by France.\n(16) The request covers vessels with a track record in the fishery of more than five years and which operate under a management plan adopted by France on 15 April 2014\u00a0(2) in accordance with Article 19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(17) Those vessels are included on a list communicated to the Commission in line with the requirements of Article\u00a013(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(18) The fishing activities concerned fulfil the requirements of Article 4, Article 8(1)(h) and Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(19) The fishing activities concerned fulfil the recording requirements set out in Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\u00a0(3).\n(20) The fishing activities concerned do not interfere with the activities of vessels using gears other than trawls, seines or similar towed nets.\n(21) The activity of \u2018gangui\u2019 trawlers is regulated in the French management plan to ensure that catches of species mentioned in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 are minimal.\n(22) \u2018Gangui\u2019 trawlers do not target cephalopods.\n(23) The French management plan includes measures for the monitoring of fishing activities, as provided for in the fifth subparagraph of Article 4(5) and in the third subparagraph of Article 13(9) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01967/2006.\n(24) The requested derogations should therefore be granted.\n(25) France should report to the Commission in due time and in accordance with the monitoring plan provided for in the French management plan.\n(26) A limitation in duration of the derogation should be established in order to allow prompt corrective management measures in case the report to the Commission shows a poor conservation status of the exploited stock while providing scope to improve the scientific basis for an improved management plan.\n(27) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Derogations\nArticles 4(1) and 13(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 shall not apply in territorial waters of France adjacent to the coast of the Provence-Alpes- C\u00f4te d'Azur region to \u2018gangui\u2019 trawlers:\n(a) bearing the registration number mentioned in the French management plan;\n(b) having a track record in the fishery of more than five years and not involving any future increase in the fishing effort deployed; and\n(c) holding a fishing authorisation and operating under the management plan adopted by France in accordance with Article 19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.", "Monitoring plan and reporting\nFrance shall communicate to the Commission, within three years following the entry into force of this Regulation, a report drawn up in accordance with the monitoring plan established in the management plan referred to in Article 1(c).", "Entry into force and period of application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply until 6 June 2017.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a036, 8.2.2007, p.\u00a06.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Reference JORF No 0101, 30.4.2014, p. 7452.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No\u00a0768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No\u00a01098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No\u00a01966/2006 (OJ\u00a0L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a01)."}
