The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) has developed test guidelines.\n(4) Directive 72/168/EEC was amended by Directive 2002/8/EC to ensure consistency between the CPVO test guidelines and the conditions for examining the varieties with a view to their acceptance in the national catalogues of varieties of the Member States, as far as CPVO test guidelines had been established. The CPVO has since issued guidelines for a number of other species.\n(5) It is appropriate to ensure consistency between the CPVO test guidelines and the conditions for the varieties, with a view to their acceptance into national catalogues of the Member States.\n(6) It is appropriate to base the Community system on the UPOV test guidelines, in so far as CPVO has not yet developed specific guidelines. National law applies for the species not covered by this Directive.\n(7) Directive 72/168/EEC should therefore be repealed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["1.
