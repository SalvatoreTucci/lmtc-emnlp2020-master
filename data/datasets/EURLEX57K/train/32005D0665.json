Certain establishments have ceased their activities. Those establishments should therefore be deleted from the list of establishments in transition.\n(4) The status of two meat establishments and their reclassification as low capacity establishments is still under discussion with the Hungarian competent authority. It is necessary to foresee a short supplementary time in view to clarify the situation.\n(5) Furthermore a limited number of establishments have made considerable efforts to comply with structural requirements laid down by Community legislation. However those establishments are not in a position to finish their upgrading process by the prescribed deadline due to exceptional technical constraints. Therefore it is justified to allow them further time to complete the upgrading process.\n(6) Appendix A to Annex X to the 2003 Act of Accession should therefore be amended accordingly. For the sake of clarity, it should be replaced.\n(7) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has been informed of the measures provided for in this Decision,", "main_body": ["Appendix A to the Annex X to the 2003 Act of Accession is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 September 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p. 2012/64.
