The processing of non-originating live lobsters into cooked and frozen tails, legs and claws will replace the production chain of the snow crab, which the company concerned cannot procure.\n(3) The requested derogation is justified under Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC and, specifically, under Article 37(1) thereof, in particular as regards the development of an existing industry in Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The derogation is essential for the preservation of the activity of the plant in question, which employs a significant number of people. Subject to compliance with certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration, the derogation would not cause serious injury to an established industry of the Community or one or more of the Member States.\n(4) Accordingly, a derogation should be granted in respect of certain quantities of cooked and frozen lobster tails, legs and claws processed in Saint Pierre and Miquelon and imported into the Community.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down the provisions for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1335/2003(3), lays down rules for the management of tariff quotas. Those rules should be applied mutatis mutandis to the management of the quantities in respect of which the derogation in question is granted.\n(6) Saint Pierre and Miquelon requested that the derogation apply from 1 September 2003. However, given the date on which Saint Pierre and Miquelon submitted its request and the length of the decision process, the derogation cannot be adopted before 1 September. As a result, it will apply from 1 October 2003.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from the provisions of Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC, cooked and frozen lobster tails, legs and claws covered by CN code ex 0306 12 90 which are processed in Saint Pierre and Miquelon are regarded as originating in Saint Pierre and Miquelon where they are obtained from non-originating lobsters, in accordance with the terms of this Decision.", "The derogation provided for in Article 1 applies to the quantities shown in the Annex which are imported into the Community from Saint Pierre and Miquelon during the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2008.", "Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 relating to the management of tariff quotas apply mutatis mutandis to the management of the quantities referred to in the Annex.", "1.
