Demand of consumers in the Community is increasing, especially for high-quality beef. An additional reduced-tariff-quota for high-quality beef would satisfy at the same time the consumer interests as well as supplier interests. It would not have a significant impact on the total volume of beef imports into the Community.\n(3) All operators concerned in the Community should be offered equal and continuous access to that quota. It is also necessary to insure appropriate monitoring. To this end, the utilisation of the quota should be based on the presentation of a certificate of authenticity guaranteeing the type and origin of the products.\n(4) Under Article 32 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), tariff quotas for the products covered by this Regulation are to be administered by the Commission in accordance with detailed rules adopted under the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the said Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.

The applicable duty for the quota shall be 20 % ad valorem.\n3.
