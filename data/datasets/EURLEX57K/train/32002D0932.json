The purpose is to guarantee correspondence between measures and programme objectives.\nImplementation report and scrutiny of programme\n4. France shall notify to the Commission, within one month of adoption of the programme, the name of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the final implementation report.\nThe final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished) and an assessment of the immediate phytosanitary and economic impact.\nThe final report on the present programme will be presented by the competent authority to the Commission on 30 September 2003 at the latest and shall thereafter be presented to the Standing Committee on Plant Health as soon as possible after that date.\n5. The Commission may jointly with France call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment referred to in point 3. He may submit proposals for adjustment of the subprogrammes and/or measures, and amending the selection criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall give an opinion on the administrative measures to be taken.\nC. INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY\nIn the framework of this action, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure that it is adequately publicised.\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n- make potential recipients and professional organisations aware of the possibilities offered under the programme measures,\n- make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\nFrance and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives envisaged in this area, possibly through the Monitoring Committee.

By \"a single piece of work\" is meant a product of building or civil engineering works intended in itself to fulfil an economic or technical function.\nThe ceilings will be those in force on the date of notification of this Decision.\n2.
