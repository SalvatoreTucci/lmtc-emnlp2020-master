DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to kiwifruit (also known as 'actinidia' or 'kiwis') of varieties (cultivars) derived from Actinidia chinensis (Planch.) or Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev., C. F., Liang and A. R. Ferguson), to be supplied fresh to the consumer, kiwifruit for industrial processing being excluded.\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of this standard is to define the quality requirements for kiwifruit, after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the kiwifruit must be:\n- intact (but free of peduncle),\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter,\n- adequately firm: not soft, or shrivelled or water-soaked,\n- well-formed; double or multiple fruits are excluded,\n- practically free of pests,\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n- free from abnormal external moisture,\n- free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\nThe kiwifruit must be sufficiently developed and display satisfactory ripeness (1). The development and the condition must be such as to enable them:\n- to withstand transport and handling, and\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB. Classification\nKiwifruit are classified into three classes, as defined below:\n(i) 'Extra' class\nKiwifruit in this class must be of superior quality. They must be well developed and have all the characteristics and the colouring typical of the variety.\nThey must be free from defects apart from a very slight superficial deterioration, on condition that this does not affect the quality and general appearance of the produce or its presentation in the package.\n(ii) Class I\nKiwifruit in this class must be of good quality.\nThey must be firm and the flesh must be perfectly sound.\nThey must present the characteristics of the variety. The following defects, however, may be allowed provided that these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation of the package:\n- a slight defect in shape (but free of swelling or malformations),\n- a slight defect in colouring,\n- superficial skin defects, provided that the total area affected does not exceed 1 cm2,\n- a small 'Hayward mark' like longitudinal lines, and without protuberance.\n(iii) Class II\nThis class includes kiwifruit which do not qualify for inclusion in the higher classes, but which satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\nThe fruit must be reasonably firm and the flesh should not show any serious defects.\nThe following defects, however, may be allowed provided that the kiwifruit retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, the keeping quality and presentation:\n- defects of shape,\n- defects in colouring,\n- skin defects, such as small healed cuts or scarred/grazed tissue, provided that the total area affected does not exceed 2 cm2,\n- several, more pronounced 'Hayward marks', with light protuberance,\n- slight bruising.\nIII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING\nSizing is determined by the weight of the fruit.\nThe minimum weight for 'extra' class is 90 grams, for class I is 70 grams and that for class II is 65 grams.\nThe difference in weight between the largest and the smallest fruit in any one package must not exceed:\n- 15 grams for fruit weighing less than 85 grams,\n- 20 grams for fruit weighing between 85 grams and 120 grams,\n- 30 grams for fruit weighing 120 grams or more.\nIV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES\nTolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.\nA. Quality tolerances\n(i) 'Extra' class\n5 % by number or weight of kiwifruit not satisfying the requirements of the class but meeting those of class I, or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances for that class.\n(ii) Class I\n10 % by number or weight of kiwifruit not satisfying the requirements of the class but meeting those of class II, or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances for that class.\n(iii) Class II\n10 % by number or weight of kiwifruit satisfying neither the requirements for the class nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\nB. Size tolerances\nFor all classes:\n10 % by number or weight of kiwifruit not satisfying the requirements as regards the minimum weight and/or the size range specified.\nHowever, the fruit must be of a size immediately below or above the size indicated or, in the case of the smallest size, they must not weigh less than 85 grams in 'extra' class, 67 grams in class I and 62 grams in class II.\nV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION\nA. Uniformity\nThe contents of each package must be uniform and consist exclusively of kiwifruit of the same origin, variety and quality.\nThe visible part of the contents of each package must be representative of the entire contents. B. Packaging\nThe kiwifruit must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.\nThe materials used inside the package must be new, clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce. The use of materials and particularly of paper or stamps bearing trade specifications is allowed provided that the printing or labelling has been done with a non-toxic ink or glue.\nThe packages must be free from foreign matter.\nIn 'extra' class the fruit must be presented separately from one another, and be regularly arranged on one layer.\nVI. PROVISIONS CONCERNING MARKING\nEach package must bear the following particulars in letters grouped on the same side, legibly and indelibly marked and visible from the outside:\nA. Identification\n1.2 // Packer and/or dispatcher   // Name and address or officially issued or accepted code mark.\nB. Nature of produce\n- 'kiwifruit' and/or 'Actinidia', where the contents are not visible from the outside,\n- Name of the variety (optional).\nC. Origin of produce\nCountry of origin and optionally, district where grown or national, regional or local place name.\nD. Commercial specifications\n- Class,\n- Size expressed by minimum and maximum weight of the fruit, if not packed in rows,\n- Number of fruits, if packed in rows.\nE. Official control mark\n(optional).\n(1) In order to satisfy this requirement, the fruit when harvested must have attained a degree of ripeness of at least 6,2 %, assessed by the Brix test."}
