Equivalence may be made for products placed in different locations; equivalence may be made also for products placed in the same location. Equivalence is forbidden for products in some situations, such as intervention products intended for export. As a general rule, equivalence is not allowed in the framework of the prefinancing for storage, without prejudice to specific sector regulations that provide that certain products can be stored in bulk in the same silo or storage location with other products having another customs status. The European Court of Auditors in its Special Report No 1/2003 has noted that the system of equivalence is unnecessarily complex and difficult to control. Furthermore the Court has found that the rules have been applied very differently in different Member States, and even in different regions within the same Member State. It is therefore advisable to remove the equivalence possibility from the prefinancing with processing.\n(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/2003(4), has introduced the use of real rates of yield for products processed under the prefinancing arrangements. In order to take into account the variability in yields, it is advisable to implement a certain flexibility where the declared yield turns out to be higher than the real yield.\n(3) With a view to providing a more efficient administration of the applications for payment of export refunds, it is considered appropriate that Member States may decide that only electronic applications must be used.\n(4) With a view to simplifying the administrative procedure for payment of refunds involving small quantities, the requirement of furnishing proof of import in the context of a request for equivalent documents should be waived for refunds less than or equal to EUR 2400.\n(5) With a view to simplifying the handling of files with penalties of small amounts, the minimum amount for which Member States may waive recovery should be increased.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2003, should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The Management Committees concerned have not delivered opinions within the time limits set by their chairmen,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 is amended as follows:\n1.
