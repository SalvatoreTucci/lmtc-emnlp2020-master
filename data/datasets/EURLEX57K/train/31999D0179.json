Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application. Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications.\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex.\nThese criteria aim in particular at limiting the levels of toxic residues and the emissions of volatile organic compounds, and at promoting a more durable product.\nThe functional unit is one pair of shoes. Requirements are based on shoe size 40 Paris point. For children's shoes the requirements apply for a size 32 Paris point (or the largest size in the case of maximum sizes smaller than 32 Paris point).\nECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\n1. Residues in the final product\n(a) The average concentration of residues in the final product shall not exceed the following:\n>TABLE>\nTest methods (test report required on application)\n- Cr (VI): standard EN 420 (note that difficulties in measurement due to interferences may be encountered when analysing certain coloured leathers),\n- Cd, Pb, As: analyses by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) following digestion by strong acid.\nSample preparation:\n(1) Separate the upper components from the bottom components,\n(2) grind completely the upper components and the bottom components, keeping both separate,\n(3) analyse a sample of each of these two preparations,\n(4) the concentrations of the above substances in each of these two samples shall not exceed the above values.\n(b) The amount of free and partially hydrolysable formaldehyde of the textile components of the footwear shall not exceed 75 ppm and of the leather components shall not exceed 150 ppm.\nTest methods (test report required on application)\n- textiles: Japan Law 112, SFS 4996 or Preniso 14184-1\n- leather: IUC 94.50001 a or DIN 53315\n2. Emissions from the production of material\nThe waste water from leather tanning sites shall be treated, either by an in-house or municipal waste water treatment plant/facility, so as to achieve a reduction of the COD content of at least 75 %.\nTest method (test report and appropriate complementary data required on application)\nCOD: ISO 6060 water quality, determination of chemical oxygen demand\n3. Use of harmful substances (up until purchase)\n(a) Pentachlorphenol (PCP) and its salts and esters shall not be used.\nTest method (for purposes of verification)\n>TABLE>\n(b) No azo dyes shall be used that may cleave to any of the following aromatic amines:\n>TABLE>\nTest method (for purposes of verification)\n- textiles: German method B-82.02 or equivalent, limit 30 ppm. (Note that false positives are possible for 4-aminoazobenzene and confirmation is therefore recommended),\n- leather: standard DIN 53316, limit 30 ppm. (Note that false positives are possible for 4-aminoazobenzene, 4-aminodiphenyl and 2-naphthylamine and confirmation is therefore recommended).\n4. Use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during final assembly of shoes\nThe total use of VOCs during final footwear production, for the following categories, shall not exceed on average:\n>TABLE>\nVOCs are any organic compound having at 293,15 K a vapour pressure of 0,01 kPa or more, or having a corresponding volatility under the particular conditions of use.\nThe total use of VOCs during final shoe production shall be calculated as follows:\nM(VOCtotal) = \u00d3 (M(adhesives) \u00d7 C(VOCa)) + \u00d3 (A(finishes) \u00d7 M(finishes) \u00d7 C(VOCf))\nWhere:\n>TABLE>\nRegistration of purchased leather, adhesives, finishes and production of footwear over at least the last six months is required.\n5. Electric components\nThe footwear shall not contain any electric or electronic components.\n6. Packaging of the final product\n(a) Where cardboard boxes are used for the final packaging of footwear, they shall be made from a minimum of 80 % recycled material.\n(b) Where plastic bags are used for the final packaging of footwear, they shall be made from recycled material.\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\n7. User instructions\nThe following information shall be supplied with the product:\n- these shoes have been treated to improve their water resistance. They do not require further treatment. (This criterion is applicable only to footwear that has been water-resistant treated),\n- where possible repair your footwear rather than throw them away. This is less damaging to the environment.\nFITNESS FOR USE CRITERIA\n8. Parameters contributing to durability\nOccupational and safety footwear must carry the CE mark (in accordance with Council Directive 89/686/EEC (1) on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment). All other footwear must meet the requirements indicated in the table below (test report required on application). The parameters referred to are measured according to the following test methods:\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\nIn addition, specialist cold footwear shall meet the following requirements for water resistance:\n- uppers: penetration time &ge; 240 min, absorption\n(1) OJ L 399, 30. 12. 1989, p. 18."}
