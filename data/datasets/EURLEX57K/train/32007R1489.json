It needs to be amended to take into account the adoption of the euro by further Member States.\n(3) National central banks (NCBs) should be allowed to grant, on a non-discriminatory basis, derogations from the reporting requirements to individual electronic money institutions in certain situations.

With regard to small MFIs that are not credit institutions, NCBs that decide to relieve small MFIs of full reporting requirements should inform the institutions concerned thereof, but continue, as a minimum, to collect data relating to the total balance sheet at least at an annual frequency so that the size of the reporting \u201ctail\u201d can be monitored.\n2. Pursuant to Article 2(4), NCBs may grant derogations from their statistical reporting requirements to individual electronic money institutions if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n(a) the electronic money that they issue is accepted as payment only by a limited number of undertakings, which can be clearly distinguished by:\n(i) their location in the same premises or other limited local area, and/or\n(ii) their close financial or business relationship with the issuing institution, such as a shared ownership, marketing or distribution structure,\n(b) over three-quarters of their total balance sheet is unrelated to the issuance or administration of electronic money and the liabilities relating to outstanding electronic money do not exceed EUR 100 million.\n3. If an individual electronic money institution that fulfils the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 is not exempted from the minimum reserve requirements, it will be required to report, as a minimum, the quarterly data necessary to calculate the reserve base, as laid down in Annex II. The institution may choose to report the restricted set of reserve base data at a monthly frequency.\n4. Whenever an individual electronic money institution is granted a derogation pursuant to Article 2(4), the ECB will, for statistical purposes, record the institution in the list of MFIs as a non-financial corporation. The institution will also be treated as a non-financial corporation in situations where it is the counterparty of an MFI. The institution will continue to be treated as a credit institution for the purposes of the Eurosystem\u2019s minimum reserve requirements.\u2019\nANNEX IV\nAnnex V to Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) is amended as follows:\n1. Paragraph 1a is replaced by the following:\n\u20181a. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, first reporting according to this Regulation in respect of cells corresponding to Member States that have not adopted the euro in Tables 3 and 4 of Part 2 of Annex I begins with the first quarterly data after the date of their accession to the EU.\u2019\n2. Paragraph 1b is replaced by the following:\n\u20181b. If the relevant NCB decides not to require first reporting of insignificant data beginning with the first quarterly data after the date of the relevant Member State or Member States\u2019 accession to the EU, reporting starts 12 months after the NCB informs the reporting agents that data are required.\u2019\n3. Paragraph 1c is replaced by the following:\n\u20181c. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, first reporting according to this Regulation in respect of cells corresponding to Member States that have adopted the euro in Table 3 of Part 2 of Annex I begins with the first quarterly data after the date of their adoption of the euro.\u2019\n4. Paragraphs 1d and 1e are deleted.\n5. Paragraph 2a is replaced by the following:\n\u20182a. For the first 12 months that they are reported, significant data in respect of cells corresponding to Member States that have not adopted the euro in Tables 3 and 4 of Part 2 of Annex I may be reported to the ECB with a delay of a further one month from the close of business on the 28th working day following the end of the quarter to which the data relate. The NCBs may decide when they need to receive data from reporting agents in order to meet this deadline.\u2019"}
