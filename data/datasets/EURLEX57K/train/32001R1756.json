Article 19(2) and (3) lays down that areas set aside must so remain for a period commencing on 15 January at the latest and ending on 31 August at the earliest and must not, except where otherwise provided for, be used for agricultural production or for any lucrative purpose.\n(2) Weather conditions in recent months have been characterised by an extreme drought in certain regions of Austria which has considerably affected the supply of feed and exposed producers to serious income losses from having to sell their livestock in situations where their usual feed cannot be ensured.\n(3) It is therefore desirable to find additional local feed alternatives for the month of August to feed livestock until the autumn.\n(4) The situation described above justifies derogations from Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 by authorising, in the regions concerned, the use of set-aside land for arable crops to feed livestock before the end of the set-aside period (on 31 August at the earliest), while providing for measures to ensure that use of the land concerned is not lucrative.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
