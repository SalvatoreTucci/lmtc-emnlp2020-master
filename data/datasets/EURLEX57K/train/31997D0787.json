The grant component of this assistance shall consist of an amount of ECU 10 million for 1997 and of ECU 17 million annually for the 1998-2002 period. The annual grants shall be made available insofar as the net debtor position of the beneficiary countries towards the Community has been reduced by at least a similar amount.\n4. The financial assistance provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3 will only be disbursed to the beneficiary countries on condition that:\n(a) those countries have fully settled all existing obligations towards the Community;\n(b) those countries are satisfactorily implementing a comprehensive adjustment and reform programme in the context of an IMF programme.\n5.

Refinancing or restructuring operations shall respect the conditions of paragraph 1. Those operations shall not lead to the extension of the average maturity of the borrowing concerned or to the increase of the amount, expressed at the current exchange rate, of capital outstanding at the date of the refinancing or restructuring.\n4. All related costs incurred by the Community in concluding and carrying out the operations under this Decision shall be borne by the beneficiary countries.\n5.
