After the registration ESMA should assess as part of its ongoing supervision the continuous compliance of credit rating agencies with the provision of Article 8(3) whenever it considers such assessment necessary.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, in particular Article 23 thereof, does not permit ESMA, the Commission or any public authorities of a Member State to interfere with the content of credit ratings or methodologies. Accordingly, this Regulation should lay down the rules by which those methodologies are to be assessed but should not provide for those authorities to decide on the accuracy of a credit rating produced by those methodologies.\n(5) Article 6(2) when read in conjunction with point 9 of Section A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 requires a credit rating agency to establish a review function responsible for periodically reviewing its methodologies, models and key rating assumptions, such as mathematical or correlation assumptions, and any significant changes or modifications thereto as well as the appropriateness of those methodologies, models and key rating assumptions where they are used or intended to be used for the assessment of new financial instruments.\n(6) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by ESMA to the Commission for endorsement by the Commission pursuant to the procedure laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.\n(7) ESMA has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group established under Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. In addition, ESMA has launched a call for evidence in May 2011 in order to gather information from market participants,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the rules to be used in the assessment of compliance of credit rating methodologies with the requirements set out in Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.", "Demonstration of compliance\nA credit rating agency shall at all times be able to demonstrate to ESMA its compliance with the requirements set out in Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 relating to the use of credit rating methodologies.", "Assessment of compliance by ESMA\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to examining the compliance of credit rating agencies with the provision of Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 in relation to an application for registration according to Article 15 of that Regulation, ESMA shall examine compliance by each credit rating agency with Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on an ongoing basis as ESMA considers appropriate.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When examining the compliance of credit rating agencies with the provision of Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 ESMA shall use all information relevant to assess the process of developing, approving, using and reviewing credit rating methodologies.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In determining the appropriate level of assessment, ESMA shall consider whether a credit rating methodology has a demonstrable history of consistency and accuracy in predicting credit worthiness and may have regard to methods of validation such as appropriate default or transition studies designed to test that specific methodology.", "Assessing that a credit rating methodology is rigorous\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A credit rating agency shall use and apply credit rating methodologies which:\n(a) contain clear and robust controls and processes for their developments and related approvals that allow suitable challenge;\n(b) incorporate all driving factors deemed relevant in determining creditworthiness of a rated entity or a financial instrument which shall be supported by statistical, historical experience or evidence;\n(c) consider the modelled relationship between rated entities or financial instruments of the same risk factor and risk factors to which the credit rating methodologies are sensitive;\n(d) incorporate reliable, relevant and quality related analytical models, key credit rating assumptions and criteria where these are in place.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A credit rating agency shall list and provide a detailed explanation of the following points with regard to the credit rating methodologies used regarding:\n(a) each qualitative factor, including the scope of qualitative judgement for that factor;\n(b) each quantitative factor, including key variables, data sources, key assumptions, modelling and quantitative techniques.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The detailed explanation referred to in paragraph 2 shall include the following:\n(a) a statement of the importance of each qualitative or quantitative factor used within that credit rating methodology including, where relevant, a description of and justification for related weightings assigned to those factors and their impact on credit ratings;\n(b) an assessment of the relationship between the key assumptions used in that credit rating methodology and the critical risk factors derived from macroeconomic or financial data;
