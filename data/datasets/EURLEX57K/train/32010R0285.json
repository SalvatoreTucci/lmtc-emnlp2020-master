Therefore, the limits of liability have been revised accordingly.\n(5) The minimum insurance requirements in respect of liability for passengers, baggage and cargo, established by Regulation (EC) No 785/2004, should be timely adjusted to the revised limits of liability under the Montreal Convention which have become effective on 30 December 2009.\n(6) For liability in respect of passengers the minimum insurance requirements of Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 have been set at a level significantly exceeding the revised limits of liability under the Montreal Convention.\n(7) In respect of liability for baggage and cargo the minimum insurance requirements of Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 should be increased to the level of the revised limits of liability under the Montreal Convention.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council of 24 September 2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community\u00a0(3),", "main_body": ["In Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 785/2004, paragraphs (2) and (3) are replaced by the following:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For liability in respect of baggage, the minimum insurance cover shall be 1\u00a0131\u00a0SDRs per passenger in commercial operations.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For liability in respect of cargo, the minimum insurance cover shall be 19\u00a0SDRs per kilogram in commercial operations.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 April 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0138, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0194, 18.7.2001, p.\u00a038.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0293, 31.10.2008, p.\u00a03."}
