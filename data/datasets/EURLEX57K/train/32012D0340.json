As regards certified seed, however, the possibility has been introduced some time ago, to choose between official field inspections and field inspections under official supervision.\n(2) Providing for the possibility to choose between official field inspections and field inspections under official supervision may also constitute an improved alternative to requiring official field inspection as far as basic seed and bred seed of generations prior to basic seed are concerned. A temporary experiment should therefore be organised to assess this alternative.\n(3) Taking into account the experience gained, as regards certified seed, with field inspections under official supervision, it is appropriate to carry out the experiment applying the same provisions as apply to certified seed in order to assess whether those provisions are suitable for basic seed and bred seed of generations prior to basic seed.\n(4) It is necessary to release Member States participating in the experiment from the obligations with respect to official field inspections provided for in Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC, 2002/55/EC and 2002/57/EC.\n(5) Member States participating in the experiment should report annually.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nA temporary experiment is organised at Union level assessing, as regards certification of basic seed and bred seed of generations prior to basic seed, whether the possibility to choose between official field inspections and field inspections under official supervision, carried out in accordance with Articles 2 and 3, may constitute an improved alternative to official field inspections and whether the same provisions as apply to the certification of certified seed are to be applied to basic seed and bred seed of generations prior to basic seed.\nThe purpose of that experiment is to decide whether, as regards basic seed and bred seed of generations prior to basic seed, the requirement of official field inspections may be replaced by a requirement of either official field inspections or field inspections under official supervision as regards the following provisions:\n(a) Article 2(1)(B)(1)(d) of Directive 66/401/EEC and Article 14a(a) thereof and point (6) of Annex I thereto;\n(b) Article 2(1)(C)(d) of Directive 66/402/EEC, Article 2(1)(Ca)(c) thereof, Article 2(1)(D)(1)(d) thereof, Article 2(1)(D)(2)(b) thereof, Article 2(1)(D)(3)(c) thereof and Article 14a(a) thereof and point (7) of Annex I thereto;\n(c) Article 2(1)(c)(iv) of Directive 2002/54/EC and Article 21(a) thereof and point (4) of Part A of Annex I thereto;\n(d) Article 2(1)(c)(iv) of Directive 2002/55/EC and Article 35(a) thereof and point (2) of Annex I thereto;\n(e) Article 2(1)(c)(iv) of Directive 2002/57/EC, Article 2(1)(d)(1)(ii) thereof, Article 2(1)(d)(2)(iii) thereof and Article 18(a) thereof and point (5) of Annex I thereto.", "Inspectors carrying out inspections under official supervision\nParticipating Member States shall ensure that inspectors carrying out inspections under official supervision fulfil the following conditions:\n(a) They have the necessary technical qualifications.\n(b) They derive no private gain in connection with the inspections.\n(c) They have been officially licensed by the seed certification authority of the Member State concerned to carry out inspections under official supervision; licensing shall include either the swearing-in of inspectors or the signature by inspectors of a written statement of commitment to the rules governing official inspections.\n(d) They carry out inspections under the supervision of the competent seed certification authority.", "Inspections of crops and harvested seeds\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Participating Member States shall ensure that inspections of crops and harvested seed fulfil the requirements provided for in paragraphs 2 to 5.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The crop to be inspected shall be grown from seed which has undergone official post-control, the results of which satisfy the requirements laid down in Annexes I to Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC, 2002/55/EC and 2002/57/EC.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A proportion of at least 20\u00a0% of the crops shall be checked by the competent authority, as regards vegetable crops covered by Directive 2002/55/EC.
