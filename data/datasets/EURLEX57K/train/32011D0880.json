It provides for emergency measures to be taken by the Commission where it is evident that food or feed imported from a third country is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment, and that such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs\u00a0(2) lays down general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of foodstuffs. Those rules include hygiene requirements to ensure that imported foods are of at least the same hygiene standards as food produced in the Union, or are of an equivalent standard.\n(3) Certain lots of fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt have been identified as the causative agent of an outbreak in the Union of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli bacteria (STEC), serotype O104:H4. The origin of the outbreak was identified as fenugreek seeds from Egypt consumed as sprouts.\n(4) Accordingly, Commission Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU\u00a0(3) introduced a ban on the release for free circulation in the Union of certain seeds and beans imported from Egypt that fall within the CN codes listed in the Annex thereto. That ban expires on 31 March 2012.\n(5) However, dried split leguminous vegetables, broken soya beans or broken oil seeds and oleaginous fruits are not used for sprouting purposes. Dried split leguminous vegetables, broken soya beans or broken oil seeds and broken oleaginous fruits imported from Egypt should no longer be considered as a food safety risk and should be reauthorised for import into the Union.\n(6) The emergency measures laid down in Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU should therefore be amended on the basis on this new information.\n(7) The Annex to Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Implementing Decision 2011/402/EU is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 7.7.2011, p. 10.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nSeeds and beans from Egypt whose release for free circulation in the Union is prohibited until 31 March 2012\nCN Code\u00a0(1) Description\nex\u00a00704\u00a090\u00a090 Rocket sprouts\nex\u00a00706\u00a090\u00a090 Beetroot sprouts, radish sprouts\nex\u00a00708 Sprouts of leguminous vegetables, fresh or chilled\nex\u00a00709\u00a090\u00a090 Soya bean sprouts\nex\u00a00713 Dried leguminous vegetables, shelled, whether or not skinned, not broken\n0910\u00a099\u00a010 Fenugreek seeds\nex\u00a01201\u00a000 Soya beans not broken\n1207\u00a050 Mustard seeds\nex\u00a01207\u00a099\u00a097 Other oil seeds and oleaginous fruits, not broken\n1209\u00a010\u00a000 Sugar beet seeds\n1209\u00a021\u00a000 Lucerne (alfalfa) seeds\n1209\u00a091 Vegetable seeds\nex\u00a01214\u00a090\u00a090 Lucerne (alfalfa) sprouts\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The \u201cCN codes\u201d mentioned in this Decision refer to codes specified in Part Two of Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0CN code as at 1.1.2012.\u2019"}
