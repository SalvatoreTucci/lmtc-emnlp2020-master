That Decision suspends the importation of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game and hatching eggs, fresh meat and meat preparations and meat products from these species. By Decision 2006/263/EC those measures were extended to the administrative district of Blagoevgrad.\n(3) On 17 April 2006 Bulgaria confirmed an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the administrative district (county) of Burgas in Bulgaria.\n(4) Taking account of the current epidemiology situation in Bulgaria in relation to Newcastle disease and the fact that that country has applied certain disease control measures and has sent further information on the disease situation to the Commission, it appears that the situation in Bulgaria, except for the regions of Vratsa, Blagoevgrad and Burgas is still satisfactory. It is therefore appropriate to limit the suspension of imports to those regions.\n(5) The Annex to Decision 2005/648/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Decision 2005/648/EC the Annex is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
