Later notifications only serve statistical purposes, so a single notification at the end of July would be sufficient for such quantities.\n(5) Under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1084/95 of 15 May 1995 abolishing the protective measure applicable to imports of garlic originating in Taiwan and replacing it with a certificate of origin\u00a0(5) a certificate of origin is required for the import of garlic from Taiwan. It provides for a regime similar to that laid down in Chapter IV of Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 for garlic of certain other origins. In the interests of legislative simplification and readability, it is appropriate to list all countries to which an origin certificate for garlic is needed in one place. Taiwan should therefore be added to the list of countries in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 to which Chapter IV of that Regulation is applied. Regulation (EC) No 1084/95 should therefore be repealed.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 is amended as follows:\n1. paragraph 1 of Article 10 is replaced by the following:\n2. in Article 12(1), the first and the second subparagraphs are replaced by the following:\n(a) the end of November for the quantities on which information is available by that date, and\n(b) the end of July for the remainder of the quantities for the import tariff quota period in question.\u2019;\n3.
