The study has been developed together with stakeholders and interested parties from the EU and third countries, and the results have been made publicly available.\n(4) It has been stated in the preparatory study that standby functionalities and off-mode losses occur for the majority of electrical and electronic household and office equipment products sold in the Community, while the annual electricity consumption related to standby functionalities and off-mode losses in the Community has been estimated to be 47\u00a0TWh in 2005, corresponding to 19\u00a0Mt CO2 emissions. Without taking specific measures, the consumption is predicted to increase to 49\u00a0TWh in 2020. It has been concluded that the electricity consumption of standby functionalities and off-mode losses can be significantly reduced.\n(5) Improvements of electricity consumption of standby functionalities and off-mode losses should be achieved by applying existing non-proprietary cost-effective technologies, which lead to a reduction of the combined expenses for purchasing and operating equipment.\n(6) Ecodesign requirements for the power consumption of standby mode and off mode of electrical and electronic household and office equipment should be set with a view to harmonising ecodesign requirements on standby mode and off mode throughout the Community and contributing to the functioning of the internal market and to improvement of the environmental performance of the products affected.\n(7) The ecodesign requirements should not have negative impact on the functionality of the product and should not affect negatively health, safety and environment. In particular, the benefits of reducing the electricity consumption during the use phase should over-compensate potential additional environmental impacts during the production phase of equipment having standby functionalities and/or off-mode losses.\n(8) The application of this Regulation should be limited to products corresponding to household and office equipment intended for use in the domestic environment, which, for information technology equipment, corresponds to class B equipment as set out in EN 55022:2006. The scope should be defined such that equipment that is not yet available on the market, but have similar functionalities to those products explicitly named in this Regulation, are designed to fulfil the requirements. When appropriate, an amendment to this Regulation can complement the list of products.\n(9) Operating modes not covered by this Regulation, such as the ACPI S3 mode of computers, should be considered in product-specific implementing measures pursuant to Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(10) As a general rule, requirements on standby and off mode set out in product-specific implementing measures pursuant to Directive 2005/32/EC should not be less ambitious than those set out in this Regulation.\n(11) In order to prevent unnecessary losses of energy, products should ideally enter into a \u20180-Watt\u2019 consumption state when providing no function. The technical feasibility and appropriateness should be considered on a product-by-product basis in the relevant implementing measure pursuant to Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(12) The two-staged entry into force of the ecodesign requirements should provide an appropriate time-frame for manufacturers to redesign products as far as standby functionalities and off-mode losses are concerned. The timing of the stages should be set in such a way that negative impacts related to functionalities of equipment on the market are avoided, and cost impacts for manufacturers, in particular SMEs, are taken into account, while ensuring timely achievement of policy objectives. Measurements of the power consumption should be performed taking into account the generally recognised state of the art; manufacturers may apply harmonised standards in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(13) This Regulation should increase the market penetration of technologies yielding improved energy efficiency for standby functionalities and off-mode losses, leading to estimated energy savings of 35\u00a0TWh in 2020, compared to a business-as-usual scenario.\n(14) Pursuant to Article 8(2) of Directive 2005/32/EC, this Regulation should specify that the applicable conformity assessment procedures are the internal design control set out in Annex IV and the management system set out in Annex V to Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(15) In order to facilitate compliance checks, manufacturers should be requested to provide information in the technical documentation referred to in Annexes IV and V to Directive 2005/32/EC on the operating conditions subject to the definitions of standby/off mode, and the corresponding power consumption levels.\n(16) Benchmarks for currently available technologies with low standby and off mode power consumption should be identified. This helps to ensure wide availability and easy access to information, in particular for SMEs and very small firms, which further facilitates the integration of best-design technologies for reducing the energy consumption of standby and off mode.\n(17) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2005/32/EC,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation establishes ecodesign requirements related to standby and off mode electric power consumption.
