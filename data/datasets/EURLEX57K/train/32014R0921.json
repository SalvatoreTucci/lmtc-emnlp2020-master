That application was accompanied by information relating to the requested additional supported use as plant growth regulator in oilseed rape. It was submitted to Denmark, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Commission Regulation No. 1490/2002\u00a0(5).\n(4) Denmark assessed the information submitted by the notifier. It submitted its assessment, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report, to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, on 23 July 2012.\n(5) The Commission consulted the Authority which presented its opinion on the risk assessment of tebuconazole on 9 December 2013\u00a0(6). The draft assessment report, the addendum and the opinion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised within the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed on 11\u00a0July 2014 in the format of the Commission review report for tebuconazole.\n(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the review report for tebuconazole.\n(7) The Commission has come to the conclusion that allowing uses as a plant growth regulator to be authorised without restriction does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the approval of tebuconazole and in the Commission review report for that substance.\n(8) It is appropriate to extend the approval of tebuconazole to cover uses as a plant growth regulator without restriction. However, in order to take into account the remaining uncertainty on the potential for groundwater exposure of the metabolite 1,2,4-triazole for the representative spray uses on cereals, as a barley seed treatment and on grapes, Member States should pay particular attention to the potential for groundwater contamination, when the active substance is applied in regions with vulnerable soil or climatic conditions, in particular as regards the occurrence in groundwater of the metabolite 1,2,4-triazole.\n(9) In January 2014, Denmark finalized the evaluation of the confirmatory information as regards the risk to birds and mammals. The Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed agrees that, on the basis of the current outcome, the risk to birds and mammals is acceptable. Therefore, the conclusions of the original risk assessment are not substantially affected by the evaluation of the submitted confirmatory data. No further review by the Authority has been considered necessary.\n(10) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Regulation (EC) No 540/2011\nPart A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2008/125/EC of 19 December 2008 amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include aluminium phosphide, calcium phosphide, magnesium phosphide, cymoxanil, dodemorph, 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester, metamitron, sulcotrione, tebuconazole and triadimenol as active substances (OJ L 344, 20.12.2008, p.\u00a078).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European\u00a0Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 of 14 August 2002 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the third\u00a0stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and amending Regulation (EC) No\u00a0451/2000 (OJ L 224, 21.8.2002, p. 23).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), 2013.

In this overall assessment Member States must pay particular attention to:\n\u2014 the operator and worker safety and ensure that conditions of use prescribe the application of adequate personal protective equipment;\n\u2014 the dietary exposure of consumers to the tebuconazole (triazole) metabolites;\n\u2014 the potential for groundwater contamination, when the active substance is applied in regions with vulnerable soil or climatic conditions, in particular as regards the occurrence in groundwater of the metabolite 1,2,4-triazole;\n\u2014 the protection of granivorous birds and mammals and herbivorous mammals and must ensure that the conditions of authorisation include, where appropriate, risk mitigation measures;\n\u2014 the protection of aquatic organisms and must ensure that conditions of authorisation include risk mitigation measures such as buffer zones, where appropriate.\nThe Member States concerned shall ensure that the notifier submits to the Commission further information addressing the potential endocrine disrupting properties of tebuconazole within two years after the adoption of the OECD test guidelines on endocrine disruption or, alternatively, of Community agreed test guidelines.\u2019"}
