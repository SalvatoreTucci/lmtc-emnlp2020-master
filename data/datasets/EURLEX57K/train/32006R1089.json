Such measures may be limited to certain categories of wine and/or certain areas of production, and may apply to quality wines produced in specified regions (quality wines psr) at the request of the Member State concerned.\n(2) The Spanish Government has requested that crisis distillation be opened for quality red and ros\u00e9 wines produced in specified regions (psr) of its territory and in particular produced in the wine-growing region of Navarre.\n(3) Considerable surpluses have been recorded on the market in red and ros\u00e9 quality wines psr in Navarre, which are reflected in a fall in prices and a worrying rise in stocks towards the end of the current marketing year. In order to reverse this negative trend, and so remedy the difficult market situation, stocks of quality wine psr should be reduced to a level that can be regarded as normal in terms of covering market requirements.\n(4) Since the conditions laid down in Article 30(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 are satisfied, a crisis distillation measure should be opened for a maximum of 300\u00a0000 hectolitres of quality red and ros\u00e9 wines produced in the specified region of Navarre.\n(5) The crisis distillation opened by this Regulation must comply with the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms\u00a0(2) as regards the distillation measure provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. Other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 must also apply, in particular those concerning the delivery of alcohol to intervention agencies and the payment of advances.\n(6) The price distillers must pay producers should be set at a level that permits the market disturbance to be dealt with while allowing producers to take advantage of the possibility afforded by this measure.\n(7) The product of crisis distillation must be raw or neutral alcohol only, for compulsory delivery to the intervention agency in order to avoid disturbing the market for potable alcohol, which is supplied largely by the distillation provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Crisis distillation as provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 is hereby opened for a maximum of 300\u00a0000 hectolitres of quality red and ros\u00e9 wines produced in the specified region (psr) of Navarre, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 concerning this type of distillation.", "Producers may conclude contracts as provided for in Article 65 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 (hereinafter referred to as the contract) from 18 July to 31 August 2006.\nContracts shall be accompanied by proof that a security equal to EUR\u00a05 per hectolitre has been lodged.\nContracts may not be transferred.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the total quantity covered by the contracts submitted to the intervention agency exceeds the quantity laid down in Article 1, Spain shall determine the rate of reduction to be applied to the above contracts.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spain shall take the administrative steps necessary to approve the contracts not later than 15 September 2006.
