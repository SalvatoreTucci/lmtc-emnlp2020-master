Provision should be therefore made for the levy due to be paid in the period running from 16 October to 30 November of each year.\n(3) In order to make the levy which is payable by Member States in respect of the 2005/2006 period, available at the start of the next budget year, it is appropriate to provide that the provision concerned applies from 1 September 2006.\n(4) For the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018new Member States\u2019) the reference quantities for deliveries and direct sales were initially set out in Table (f) of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003. Subsequently and in the light of the conversions requested by producers, those quantities were adapted for each Member State by the Commission in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation.\n(5) The national reference quantities for direct sales were fixed on the basis of the situation before the accession of the new Member States. However, following the restructuring process in the dairy sectors in the new Member States and stricter hygiene provisions for direct sales, it appears that individual producers to a large extent have chosen not to apply for individual reference quantities for direct sales. Consequently, the total individual reference quantities allocated to the producers for direct sales are substantially below the national reference quantities and important unused quantities therefore remain in the national reserves for direct sales.\n(6) In order to solve this problem and to make possible the use of the direct sales quantities that may remain unused in the national reserve, it is appropriate to allow in the 2005/2006 period for a single transfer of the reference quantities for direct sales to the reference quantities for deliveries if requested by a new Member State.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 is amended as follows:\n1.
