That Decision lays down animal health rules as regards swine vesicular disease for regions of that Member State that are recognised as free from swine vesicular disease and those not recognised as free from that disease. Those regions are listed in the Annexes to Decision 2005/779/EC.\n(2) A programme for the eradication and monitoring of swine vesicular disease has been implemented in Italy for several years, with a view to achieving disease-free status in all regions of Italy.\n(3) Italy has submitted information to the Commission as regards the swine vesicular disease-free status of Sicily, demonstrating that the disease has been eradicated from that region. Following the examination of that information and given the favourable results of the implementation of the yearly eradication and monitoring programmes in Italy, it is appropriate that Sicily be recognised as free from swine vesicular disease.\n(4) Decision 2005/779/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/779/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
