It has also been traditionally broadcast on free-to-air television and commanded high viewing figures.\n(7) The finals and semi-finals of the world championships for basketball, water polo and volleyball featuring the Italian national team, apart from fulfilling the criterion of a national team involved in an international tournament of major importance, generate a particular and widespread interest in Italy, even for audiences that do not usually follow these disciplines, and they have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television with a wide television audience.\n(8) The Rugby World Cup matches which feature the Italian national team, apart from fulfilling the criterion of a national team involved in an international tournament of major importance, have a special and widespread resonance in Italy and also interest an audience that does not normally follow this sport.\n(9) Six Nations rugby matches played by the Italian national team, apart from fulfilling the criterion of a national team involved in an international tournament of major importance, have a special and widespread resonance in Italy and also interest an audience that does not normally follow this sport, and they have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television with increasingly significant audience figures.\n(10) The semi-finals and final of the Davis Cup and of the Fed Cup which feature the Italian national team, apart from fulfilling the criterion of a national team involved in an international tournament of major importance, have a particular and widespread resonance in Italy and interest audiences that would not normally follow this sport.\n(11) The final and semi-finals of the Internazionali d\u2019Italia tennis tournament which feature Italian tennis players, apart from involving Italians in an international tournament of major importance, have a particular and widespread resonance in Italy and interest audiences that would not normally follow this sport, partly because of where it takes place. The special resonance of this event is confirmed by the viewing figures, which show an apparent increase in the public\u2019s interest and passion for the sporting discipline in recent years.\n(12) The Road Cycling World Championships (men\u2019s professional race) have a particular and widespread resonance in Italy and interest people other than those who normally follow this type of event, also because of the involvement of Italian athletes, and they have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television with high viewing figures.\n(13) The first performance of the opera season at the La Scala Theatre in Milan enjoys a special and widespread resonance in Italy and interests people other than those who would normally follow this type of event, and it has a generally recognised particular cultural importance in Italy, and acts as a catalyst of Italian cultural identity.\n(14) The New Year\u2019s Concert broadcast from the La Fenice Theatre in Venice has a particular and widespread resonance in Italy and interests people other than those who would normally follow this type of event, it has a generally recognised particular cultural importance in Italy, acts as a catalyst of Italian cultural identity, and it has traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television with high viewing figures.\n(15) The Italian measures appear proportionate to justify, by the overriding reason of public interest in ensuring wide public access to broadcasts of events of major importance for society, the derogation from the fundamental freedom to provide services laid down in Article 56 TFEU.\n(16) The Italian measures are also compatible with EU competition rules in so far as the definition of the qualifying broadcasters for the broadcasting of listed events relies on objective criteria (required coverage), which allow actual and potential competition for the acquisition of the rights to broadcast these events. In addition, the number of listed events is not so disproportionate as to distort competition on the downstream free television and pay television markets.\n(17) The general proportionality of the Italian measures is supported by several factors. First, the lowering of the threshold of the required coverage of the population for qualifying broadcasters from 90\u00a0% to 80\u00a0% increases the proportionality of the measures, in so far as it increases the number of broadcasters who potentially qualify. Secondly, a voluntary mechanism has been introduced for the resolution of disputes between broadcasters as regards the definition of the technical broadcasting modalities and the payment of fair compensation for the sub-licensing of exclusive broadcasting rights. Thirdly, the entry into force of the final Italian measures will be postponed to 1 September 2012, in order to ensure that any ongoing negotiations are not adversely affected. Finally, the Italian measures make provision for situations in which the rights to the events listed are purchased by non-qualifying broadcasters, in order to ensure appropriate arrangements for sub-licensing of rights to qualifying broadcasters, and for situations in which there might be no qualifying buyers for the events listed, in order to ensure that the non-qualifying broadcaster is able to exercise its rights so as to avoid a situation in which the event listed would not be broadcast at all.\n(18) The Commission communicated the measures to be taken notified by Italy to the other Member States and presented the results of this verification at the meeting of the Committee established pursuant to Article 29 of Directive 2010/13/EU. The Committee adopted a favourable opinion at this meeting,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures to be taken by Italy, pursuant to Article 14(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU, and notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 14(2) of Directive 2010/13/EU on 21 September 2011, are compatible with Union law.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures, as finally taken by Italy, will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union as soon as they are adopted at national level and notified to the Commission.
