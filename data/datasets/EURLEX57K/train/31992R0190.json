whereas, therefore, it is appropriate to open on 1 January 1992 the Community tariff quotas laid down for the said products as, per the pro rata temporis calculation, volumes have  reached the levels indicated in Article 1 and the Annex to this Regulation;\nWhereas duties on strawberries falling within CN code 0810 10 90 are eliminated within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 1 200 tonnes;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all the Member States until the quota is  exhausted; whereas it is appropriate to take the necessary measures to ensure effective Community administration of this tariff quota while offering the Member States the opportunity to draw from the quota volume the necessary quantities corresponding  to actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within, and jointly represented by, the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the quota may be carried  out by any one of its members;\nWhereas the products set out in the Annex are subject to Community surveillance within a framework of reference quantities and pre-established timetables;\nWhereas, in order to enable the competent authorities within the Commission to establish an annual trade balance sheet for each of the products and, if necessary, to put into application the arrangement provided for in Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC)  No 1134/91, these products are subject to a statistical surveillance in accordance with Regulations (EEC) No 2658/81 (2) and (EEC) No 1736/75 (3);\nWhereas imports of the products in question are charged against the reference quantities at Community level as and when the products are entered with the customs authorities for free circulation,", "main_body": ["The customs duty applicable to imports into the Community of fresh strawberries originating in the occupied territories shall be suspended at the levels indicated below and within the limits of the Community tariff quota as shown below:\nOrder No  CN code  Description  Amount\nof quota\n(in tonnes)  Quota duty\n(%)             09.1381  0810 10 90  Fresh strawberries from 1 January to 31 March 1992  720  7", "The tariff quota referred to in Article 1 shall be administered by the Commission, which may take any appropriate measure with a view to ensuring the efficient administration thereof.", "If an importer presents, in a Member State, a declaration of entry into free circulation including a request for preferential benefit for a product covered by Article 1, and if this declaration is accepted by the customs authorities, the  Member State concerned shall draw, from the tariff quota, by means of notification to the Commission, a quantity corresponding to these needs.\nThe requests for drawing, with the indication of the date of acceptance of the said declaration, must be communicated to the Commission without delay.\nThe drawings are granted by the Commission on the basis of the date of acceptance of the declaration of entry into free circulation by the customs authorities of the Member State concerned, to the extent that the available balance so permits.\nIf a Member State does not use the quantities drawn, it shall return them as soon as possible to the tariff quota.\nIf the quantities required are greater than the available balance of the tariff quota, allocation shall be made on a pro rata basis with respect to the requests.
