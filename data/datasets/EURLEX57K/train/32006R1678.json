It also provides for the possibility of additional means of disposal of and other ways of using animal by-products, to be approved following consultation of the appropriate scientific committee.\n(2) On the basis of opinions issued by the Scientific Steering Committee and of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), to date six processes have been approved as alternative means of disposal of or ways of using animal by-products under Commission Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 of 19 January 2005 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards means of disposal or uses of animal by-products and amending its Annex VI as regards biogas transformation and processing of rendering fats\u00a0(2).\n(3) On the basis of a further application, the EFSA issued an opinion on 13 July 2006 on the safety of a thermo-mechanical process for biofuel production. The conditions under which that process was considered as a safe means of disposal for manure and digestive tract content and Category 3 material should therefore be taken into account by amending Regulation (EC) No 92/2005.\n(4) Upon reconsideration of the risks to public and animal health, Category 2 material resulting from the approved biodiesel production process should be permitted for certain technical uses or for transformation into biogas.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(a) alkaline hydrolysis process as defined in Annex I;\n(b) high pressure high temperature hydrolysis process as defined in Annex II;\n(c) high pressure hydrolysis biogas process as defined in Annex III;\n(d) biodiesel production process as defined in Annex IV;\n(e) Brookes gasification process as defined in Annex V; and\n(f) combustion of animal fat in a thermal boiler process as defined in Annex VI.\n(a) the biodiesel production process as defined in Annex IV, point 1(b)(i); and\n(b) the process of combustion of animal fat in a thermal boiler as defined in Annex VI, point 1(c)(i).\u2019;\n2. in the title and in the first sentence of Article 3, \u2018Annexes I to VI\u2019 is replaced by \u2018the Annexes\u2019;\n3.

The animal by-products are loaded into a converter and subsequently treated at a temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C for a period of eight hours. During this period, the material is constantly reduced in size using appropriate mechanical abrasion equipment.\n2. The material is subsequently treated to a temperature of 100\u00a0\u00b0C for at least two hours.\n3. The particle size of the resulting material must not be larger than 20 millimetres.\n4. The animal by-products are treated in such a manner that the time-temperature requirements laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 are achieved at the same time.\n5. During the heat treatment of the material, evaporated water is continually extracted from the air-space above the biofuel and is passed through a stainless steel condenser. The condensate is kept at a temperature of at least 70\u00a0\u00b0C for at least one hour before being discharged as waste water.\n6. After the heat treatment of the material, the resulting biofuel from the converter is then discharged and automatically conveyed by a fully covered and interlocked conveyor to incineration or co-incineration on the same site.\n7. A system of hazard analysis and critical control points is in place and maintained which allows for the control of the requirements laid down in paragraphs 1 to 6.\n8. The process is carried out in a batch mode.\u2019"}
