The amendments to those measures fall within the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, in order to avoid any distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement the relevant decisions of the Security Council as far as the Community is concerned. For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory of the Community is deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty.\n(5) For the sake of clarity, a single text containing all the relevant provisions as amended should be adopted, replacing Regulation (EC) No 1030/2003, which should be repealed.\n(6) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definition shall apply:\n\u2018technical assistance\u2019 means any technical support related to repairs, development, manufacture, assembly, testing, maintenance, or any other technical service, and may take forms such as instruction, advice, training, transmission of working knowledge or skills or consulting services.
