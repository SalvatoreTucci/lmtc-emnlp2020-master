Those acts are listed in Annex A to the Agreement. That annex was last updated by Commission Decision 2006/558/EC\u00a0(2). A number of acts in Annex A have been amended and the amending acts should be included in that Annex. A number of new Community acts falling within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement have been adopted and should also be included in Annex A.\n(2) Directive 2006/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC on the annual accounts of certain types of companies, 83/349/EEC on consolidated accounts, 86/635/EEC on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions and 91/674/EEC on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings\u00a0(3) concerns the activity and supervision of credit institutions and amends Council Directive 86/635/EEC\u00a0(4), which is already in Annex A.

It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should be included in Annex A, with the exception of Titles III and IV. Directive 2006/48/EC repeals Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(15), as amended, inter alia, by Directive 2000/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(16), Directive 2002/87/EC and Directive 2004/39/EC, which should therefore be removed from Annex A. Moreover, since Directive 2006/48/EC amends Directive 2002/87/EC, which is listed in Annex A, it should also be included as amending the latter.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 of 10 August 2006 implementing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards record-keeping obligations for investment firms, transaction reporting, market transparency, admission of financial instruments to trading, and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive\u00a0(17) and Commission Directive 2006/73/EC of 10 August 2006 implementing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive\u00a0(18) concern the activity and supervision of credit institutions and supplement Directive 2004/39/EC, as amended by Directive 2006/31/EC, which is already in Annex A.
