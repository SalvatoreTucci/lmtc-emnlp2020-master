This procedure is based on statistical principles. An essential element of this procedure is the use of a typical process standard deviation of the fat content of butter made according to a defined specification in a specified production plant and known in advance by the control authorities in Member States where the declaration for release into free circulation in the Community is presented.\n(2) The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Food Assurance Authority (MAF Food) by letter dated 1 June 2000 notified the Commission of the typical process standard deviation for each product purchasing specification in six production plants in accordance with Article 28(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98. On the basis of Article 9(9) of the same Regulation, the typical process standard deviation was approved by Commission Decision 2000/432/EC(5).\n(3) By letter dated 29 September 2000, the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Food Assurance Authority (MAF Food) notified the Commission of a revised typical process standard deviation for each product purchasing specification in five production plants in accordance with Article 28(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98. The calculation procedure used for establishing the typical process standard deviation for each product purchasing specification has been revised, because an essential element of this standard deviation was not taken into consideration. Furthermore, one of the six mentioned production plants is no longer producing butter under the current access quota. The revised figures were the object of verification and subsequent discussions with the New Zealand authorities which finally resulted in confirmation by the New Zealand authorities in a letter dated 20 July 2001, of the figures previously notified.\n(4) As required by Article 9(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98, the notified revised typical process standard deviations should be approved and communicated to Member States, and their date of entry into force should be fixed at 22 August 2001. At the same time, for reasons of clarity, Decision 2000/432/EC should be repealed,", "main_body": ["The typical process standard deviations notified to the Commission by MAF Food, New Zealand by letter of 29 September 2000 and listed in the Annex to this Decision are approved.
