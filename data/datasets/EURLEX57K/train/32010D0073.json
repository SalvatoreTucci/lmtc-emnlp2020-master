It is therefore our pleasure to confirm to you the full resumption of cooperation between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\nWe note that, in accordance with Article 4-VII of the Dakar Agreement, the different political forces which signed the Agreement have committed themselves to continuing and stepping up an inclusive national dialogue in order to consolidate national reconciliation and democracy. As stated by the members of the International Contact Group at their last meeting on 10\u00a0September\u00a02009, it is desirable that this dialogue should take place. It is already encouraging to see the readiness of the various parties to take part in the dialogue. It seems clear that certain underlying issues cited among the root causes of the coup of 6\u00a0August\u00a02008 have yet to be resolved. The topics for dialogue referred to in the Dakar Agreement include reinforcing democracy, preventing unconstitutional changes of government, reforming the institutions and the role of the armed forces, good political and economic governance, reinforcing the rule of law and human rights and restoring the balance of institutions and power. The security threats that have emerged in Mauritania underline the need, in this dialogue, to address security related issues, including the link between security and\u00a0development.\nThe European Union attaches great importance to all issues relating to the stability of your country, including those mentioned above. As these are subjects of mutual interest and given the scale of European Union cooperation in Mauritania in the area of governance, we propose that the political dialogue between Mauritania and the European Union, as provided for in Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, be strengthened and put on a regular and structured footing. The practical arrangements and terms of reference for this dialogue will have to be established by mutual agreement between your Government and the heads of the European Union\u2019s diplomatic missions to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\nOne of the objectives of this dialogue will be to promote the inclusive national dialogue mentioned above and to closely monitor its results. We believe that the preconditions and difficulties that have beset the launching of this dialogue could be resolved if the various Mauritanian parties were to focus their discussions on the future and set aside demands and disputes relating to the recent past.\nTo conclude, the European Union will support Mauritania\u2019s efforts to overcome the socio-economic and political difficulties that it is experiencing owing to the long-running political crisis connected with the coup of August 2008, the global economic crisis and the new security and terrorist threats.\nWe have the honour to be, Sir, yours faithfully,\nDone at Brussels, 25 January 2010.\nFor the European Commission\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\nFor the Council of the European Union\nC.
