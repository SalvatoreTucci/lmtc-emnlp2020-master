In some cases recognition was granted provisionally, because the information necessary to show that the harmful organism in question was not present in the Member State or area concerned had not been provided.\n(2) Where the Member States concerned have now provided the necessary information, the zones in question should be recognised as permanent protected zones.\n(3) Certain regions of Portugal were recognised as protected zones with respect to Bemisia tabaci Genn. (European populations).\n(4) Portugal has submitted information showing that Bemisia tabaci Genn. (European populations) is now established in some parts of its territory. Those parts of the Portuguese territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n(5) Various regions or parts of regions in Austria and Italy, and the whole territory of Ireland, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia, were provisionally recognised as protected zones with respect to Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. until 31 March 2006.\n(6) From information supplied by Austria, Italy, Ireland, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia, it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zones for those countries in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. should exceptionally be extended for two years to give those countries the necessary time to submit information showing that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is not present or, where necessary, to complete their efforts to eradicate that organism.\n(7) In addition, as Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in some parts of Italy, in the Gorenjska and Maribor regions of Slovenia and in some communes of the Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda, Levice, Topo\u013e\u010dany, Polt\u00e1r, Ro\u017e\u0148ava and Trebi\u0161ov Counties in Slovakia, these respective parts of the Italian, Slovenian and Slovakian territory should no longer be recognised as a protected zone for Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al.\n(8) Lithuania was provisionally recognised as a protected zone for beet necrotic yellow vein virus until 31 March 2006.\n(9) Lithuania has submitted information showing that beet necrotic yellow vein virus is now established in that country. Lithuania should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n(10) Malta was provisionally recognised as a protected zone with respect to Citrus tristeza virus (European strains) until 31 March 2006.\n(11) From information supplied by Malta, it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zone for that country in respect of Citrus tristeza virus (European strains) should exceptionally be extended for two years to give that country the necessary time to submit information showing that Citrus tristeza virus (European strains) is not present or, where necessary, to complete its efforts to eradicate that organism.\n(12) Cyprus was provisionally recognised as a protected zone with respect to Daktulosphaira vitifoliae (Fitch), Ips sexdentatus B\u00f6rner and Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say until 31 March 2006.\n(13) From information supplied by Cyprus, it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zone for that country in respect of Daktulosphaira vitifoliae (Fitch), Ips sexdentatus B\u00f6rner and Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say should be extended for two years to give that country the necessary time to submit information showing that those harmful organisms, are not present or, where necessary, to complete its efforts to eradicate them.\n(14) Directive 2001/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 2001/32/EC is amended as follows:\n1) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n2) Article 2 is deleted.\n3) The Annex is amended as follows:\n(a) In point 2 of heading (a), the words in brackets after \u2018Portugal\u2019 are replaced by the following words \u2018Azores, Beira Interior, Beira Litoral, Entre Douro e Minho, Madeira, Ribatejo e Oeste (communes of Alcoba\u00e7a, Alenquer, Bombarral, Cadaval, Caldas da Rainha, Lourinh\u00e3, Nazar\u00e9, Obidos, Peniche and Torres Vedras) and Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes\u2019.\n(b) In points 3.1, 11 and 13 of heading (a), the words \u2018(until 31 March 2008)\u2019 are inserted after the word \u2018Cyprus\u2019.\n(c) Point 2 of heading (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 Spain, Estonia, France (Corsica), Italy (Abruzzi; Basilicata; Calabria; Campania; Friuli-Venezia Giulia; Lazio; Liguria; Marche; Molise; Piedmont; Sardinia; Sicily; Tuscany; Umbria; Valle d\u2019Aosta), Latvia, Portugal, Finland, United Kingdom (Northern Ireland, Isle of Man and Channel Islands),\n\u2014 and, until 31 March 2008, Ireland, Italy (Ap\u00falia, Emilia-Romagna: provinces of Forl\u00ed-Cesena (excluding the provincial area situated to the North of the State road n.9 \u2014 Via Emilia), Parma, Piacenza, Rimini (excluding the provincial area situated to the North of the State road n.9 \u2014 Via Emilia), Lombardy, Veneto (except in the province of Rovigo the communes Rovigo, Polesella, Villamarzana, Fratta Polesine, San Bellino, Badia Polesine, Trecenta, Ceneselli, Pontecchio Polesine, Arqu\u00e0 Polesine, Costa di Rovigo, Occhiobello, Lendinara, Canda, Ficarolo, Guarda Veneta, Frassinelle Polesine, Villanova del Ghebbo, Fiesso Umbertiano, Castelguglielmo, Bagnolo di Po, Giacciano con Baruchella, Bosaro, Canaro, Lusia, Pincara, Stienta, Gaiba, Salara, and in the province of Padova the communes Castelbaldo, Barbona, Piacenza d\u2019Adige, Vescovana, S.
