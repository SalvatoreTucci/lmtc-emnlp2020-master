That Decision suspends the importation of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game and hatching eggs, fresh meat and meat preparations and meat products from these species.\n(3) On 23 January 2006 Bulgaria confirmed an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the administrative district of Blagoevgrad in Bulgaria.\n(4) Taking account of the current epidemiology situation in Bulgaria in relation to Newcastle disease and the fact that that country has applied certain disease control measures and has sent further information on the disease situation to the Commission. On the basis of this information, it appears that the situation in Bulgaria, except for the regions of Vratsa and Blagoevgrad is still satisfactory. It is therefore appropriate to limit the suspension of imports to those regions and to prolong the period of application of Decision 2005/648/EC.\n(5) The Annex to Decision 2005/648/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In order to authorise imports of meat products subjected to a heat treatment sufficient to inactivate any possible virus in the meat, it is necessary to specify the required treatment for poultry meat in the health certificates drawn up in accordance with Annexes III and IV to Commission Decision 2005/432/EC\u00a0(4).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/648/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 5 the date \u201823\u00a0August 2006\u2019 is replaced by \u201823 January 2007\u2019;\n2. the following paragraphs are added to Article 3:\n3. the Annex is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
