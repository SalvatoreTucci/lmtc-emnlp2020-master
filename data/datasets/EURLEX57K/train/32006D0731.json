Specifically, regarding clauses 4.2.6.3.1, 4.2.6.3.2 and 4.2.6.3.3 of the standard, the measures defined for designing and constructing mobile cranes do not guarantee a sufficiently high level of safety for the foreseeable use of the product. In particular, the standard does not specify adequate protective measures to prevent the misuse of the bridging device for the rated capacity limiter.\n(4) In the interest of safety and legal certainty, the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of standard should therefore be accompanied by an appropriate warning.\n(5) Member States should add an identical warning in their national standards transposing standard EN 13000:2004,", "main_body": ["The publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the references of standard EN 13000:2004 \u2018Cranes \u2014 Mobile cranes\u2019 shall be as set out in the Annex.", "Where, pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 98/37/EC, Member States publish the references of a national standard transposing harmonised standard EN 13000:2004, they shall add to that publication a warning identical to that set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 207, 23.7.1998, p. 1.

On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive.\nNote 3 In case of amendments, the referenced standard is EN CCCCC:YYYY, its previous amendments, if any, and the new, quoted amendment. The superseded standard (column 3) therefore consists of EN CCCCC:YYYY and its previous amendments, if any, but without the new quoted amendment. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive.\nNote 4 Presumption of conformity for a product is achieved by complying with the requirements of Part 1 and the relevant Part 2 when this Part 2 is also listed in the OJ under Directive 98/37/EC.\nNote:\n\u2014 Any information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European Standardisation Organisations or from the national standardisation bodies of which the list is annexed to the Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and Council\u00a0(2) amended by the Directive 98/48/EC\u00a0(3).\n\u2014 Publication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Union does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages.\n\u2014 This list replaces all the previous lists published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
