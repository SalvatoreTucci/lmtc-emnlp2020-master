Therefore, a single percentage for acceptance of the amounts actually notified should be fixed.\n(2) Luxembourg has communicated, according to Article 85s(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, eligible applications for an area smaller than 50 hectares; therefore it is exempted from the application for the single percentage of acceptance in accordance with Article 71(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 of 27 June 2008 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 on the common organisation of the market in wine as regards support programmes, trade with third countries, production potential and on controls in the wine sector\u00a0(2).\n(3) For the sake of clarity it is appropriate to indicate also the breakdown per Member State concerned of the annual budget allocated to the grubbing-up scheme.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1092/2009\u00a0(3) fixing a single percentage for acceptance of the amounts notified by the Member States to the Commission concerning the applications for the grubbing-up premium became obsolete at the end of the wine year 2009/2010.
