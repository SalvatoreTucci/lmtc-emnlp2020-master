For the period 1 June 1995 to 31 May 1996, import licences for garlic (CN code 0703 20 00) originating in China shall be issued for up to 12 000 tonnes only, subject to a maximum quantity for each sub-period as set out in the Annex.\n2. The maximum quantity for each sub-period as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equal to the sum of:\n(a) the quantity set out in the Annex;\n(b) quantities not applied for from the preceding sub-period;\nand\n(c) unused quantities from licences issued previously of which the Commission has been informed.\n3. Where the Commission establishes, on the basis of information forwarded to it by the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1859/93, that there is a risk that the maximum quantity for any sub-period may be exceeded, it shall lay down the conditions under which licences may be issued.\n4. Operators may submit not more than two licence applications per sub-period, separated by a minimum of five days, in respect of the product referred to in paragraph 1. Each application may cover not more than 50 % of the quantity available for that sub-period as set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 June 1995.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 May 1995.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 118, 20. 5. 1972, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 101, 4. 5. 1995, p. 16.\n(3) OJ No L 291, 28. 12. 1972, p. 3.\n(4) OJ No L 170, 13. 7. 1993, p. 10.\n(5) OJ No L 176, 9. 7. 1994, p. 1.\n(6) OJ No L 133, 28. 5. 1994, p. 36.\n(7) OJ No L 298, 19. 11. 1994, p. 26.\nANNEX\n>TABLE>"}
