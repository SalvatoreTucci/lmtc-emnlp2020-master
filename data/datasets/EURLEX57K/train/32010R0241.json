It also lays down the veterinary certification requirements for such commodities. The models of the veterinary certificates to accompany them are set out in Part 2 of that Annex.\n(4) Belarus is currently not listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008. It has requested to be included in that list and has submitted information to the Commission concerning its compliance with the requirements of that Regulation.\n(5) The Commission has taken a positive view of the information submitted by Belarus as regards the animal health conditions in that third country required for transit of eggs and egg products for human consumption through the Union. Therefore, it is appropriate to include that third country in the list set out in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008. However, pending the outcome of an inspection to be carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office in Belarus, the inclusion in the list should be limited to the transit of eggs and egg products for human consumption from that third country through the Union with the final destination in other third countries as the animal health risk from such introduction is very low. Such authorisation should be granted subject to the additional guarantee that the transit is carried out by road or by rail in lorries or railway wagons which have been sealed with a serially numbered seal.\n(6) As this is intended to be an interim measure it should only remain in force for 18 months from the date of entry into force.\n(7) The entry for Belarus should therefore be inserted in the list in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 and a new entry in the section \u2018Additional guarantees\u2019 in Part 2 of Annex I should be added.\n(8) Experience has shown that certification of the animal health conditions of day-old chicks by the official veterinarian at the time of consignment for imports into the Union can pose practical problems to third country competent authorities.\n(9) In order to take into account the production practices and certification procedures while ensuring that the necessary animal health conditions continue to be met, the model veterinary certificate for day-old chicks in Part 2 of Annex I should be modified.\n(10) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period to permit Member States and industry to take the necessary measures to comply with the applicable veterinary certification requirements provided for in this Regulation.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Commodities in respect of which the relevant veterinary certificates have been issued in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 may continue to be imported into or transited through the Union until 1 June 2010.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 March 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 74.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 226, 23.8.2008, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 is amended as follows:\n1.
