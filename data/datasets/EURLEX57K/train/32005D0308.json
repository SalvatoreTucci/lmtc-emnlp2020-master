The corresponding marking of the measurement site must be made at the same time as the measurement procedure.", "Notwithstanding the standard presentation referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84, pig carcases may be presented in Estonia without the head, the fore feet and the tail before being weighed and graded.

Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018Intrascope (Optical Probe)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a hexagonal-shaped probe of a maximum width of 12\u00a0millimetres (and of 19\u00a0millimetres at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a viewing window and a light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres, and having an operating distance of between 3 and 45\u00a0millimetres.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nX = the thickness of back-fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib.\nPart 2\nULTRA-FOM 300\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018Ultra-FOM 300\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with an ultrasonic probe at 3,5 MHz (Krautkr\u00e4mer MB 4 SE). The ultrasonic signal is digitised, stored and processed by a microprocessor.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase should be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nX2 = the thickness of back-fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase, at the last rib,\nX3 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as X2,\nX4 = the thickness of back-fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and the fourth last rib."}
