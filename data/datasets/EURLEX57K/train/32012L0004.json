The potential effects of their misuse are likely to be similar to the effects of misuse of pyrotechnic articles which present a low level of hazard and therefore those effects are much less severe in comparison with the other types of explosives. For reasons of proportionality, fuses, including safety fuses as well as cap-type primers, should be exempted from the system for the identification and traceability of explosives for civil use.\n(2) The development of the computerised systems needed to implement the system for the identification and traceability of explosives has taken longer than initially expected. A postponement of the application of Commission Directive 2008/43/EC\u00a0(2) is necessary to provide the explosives industry with extra time to fully develop, test, validate and, thereby, to increase the security of the electronic systems required to implement Directive 2008/43/EC. In order to allow this, the obligation on manufacturers and importers to mark explosives should be postponed by 1 year to 5 April 2013. Additional time is necessary to have the requisite electronic tracking systems implemented by all actors along the supply chain. Furthermore, stocks of explosives with longer shelf-lives which were produced earlier and were not to be marked in accordance with Directive 2008/43/EC will still be in the supply chain and it is impractical to oblige companies to maintain different types of records. The obligations on data collection and record keeping should therefore be postponed by 3 years to 5 April 2015.\n(3) Certain articles are too small to affix the code of the manufacturing site and the electronically readable information. On certain other articles, affixing a unique identification is technically impossible due to their shape or design. In those cases, the required identification should be affixed on each smallest packaging unit. Future technical progress may make it possible to affix the code of the manufacturing site and the electronically readable information on those articles. The Commission should therefore carry out a review by the end of 2020 to assess whether the required information can be affixed on the articles themselves.\n(4) Directive 2008/43/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 13(1) of Directive 93/15/EC,", "main_body": ["Directive 2008/43/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 2, the following points (d), (e) and (f) are added:\n\u2018(d) fuses, which are cord-like non-detonating igniting devices;\n(e) safety fuses, which consist of a core of fine grained black powder surrounded by a flexible woven fabric with one or more protective outer coverings and which, when ignited, burn at a predetermined rate without any external explosive effect;\n(f) cap-type primers, which consist of a metal or plastic cap containing a small amount of primary explosive mixture that is readily ignited by impact and which serve as igniting elements in small arms cartridges or in percussion primers for propelling charges.\u2019;\n(2) Article 7 is replaced by the following:\n(3) Articles 9 and 10 are replaced by the following:\n(4) the second subparagraph of Article 15(1) is replaced by the following:\n(5) the following Article 15a is inserted:\n(6) in point 3 of the Annex, the following paragraphs are added:", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 4 April 2012 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
