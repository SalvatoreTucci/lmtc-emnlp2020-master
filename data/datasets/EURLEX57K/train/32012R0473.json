Consequently, France has also notified to the other Member States, the Commission and the Authority in accordance with Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 that it has authorised the placing on the market in its territory of cherries, raspberries and blueberries containing pesticide residues higher than the MRLs. Currently, those MRLs are established at the limit of determination in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\n(3) France submitted to the Commission an appropriate consumer risk assesment and proposed temporary MRLs on that basis.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \"the Authority\", assessed the data provided and issued a statement\u00a0(3) on the safety of the proposed temporary MRLs.\n(5) The Authority concluded that the emergency use of spinetoram (XDE-175) on cherries, raspberries and blueberries is not likely to result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is not expected to pose a public health concern.\n(6) France did not report details of supervised field trials, nor complete a quality assessment of such trials. The Authority had to base its statement on the assumption that the supervised field trials are valid and confirm the proposed temporary MRLs. In order to verify the correctness of the assumption, France should update the evaluation report as soon as possible.\n(7) Based on the statement of the Authority and taking into account the factors relevant to the matter under consideration, the appropriate modifications to the MRLs fulfil the requirements of Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) Given that the emergency uses of plant protection products concerning spinetoram are already authorized by France and the resulting urgent need to ensure a high level of consumer protection, it is appropriate to provide for the MRLs by applying the procedure referred to in Article 45(5) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the next day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 70, 16.3.2005, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0European Food Safety Authority; Statement on the modification of the existing MRLs for spinetoram in cherries, raspberries and blueberries.
