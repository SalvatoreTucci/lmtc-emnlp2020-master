In the same note, an appeal was made \u2018to all States Parties to consider making their own voluntary contribution, in whatever amount, to the Trust Fund for Syria to help address what is perhaps one of the most daunting challenges in the history of the Organisation\u2019. The Trust Fund can also accept contributions from other sources, including non-governmental organisations, institutions, or private donors.\n(6) The Council of the European Union in its conclusions on 21 October 2013 welcomed the OPCW Executive Council Decision and UNSCR 2118, and reiterated the Union's readiness to consider support.\n(7) On 12 December 2003, the European Council adopted the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (the \u2018Strategy\u2019), Chapter III of which contains a list of measures that need to be taken both within the Union and in third countries to combat such proliferation.\n(8) The Strategy underlines the crucial role of the CWC and of the OPCW in creating a world free of chemical weapons.\n(9) The Union is actively implementing the Strategy and is giving effect to the measures listed in Chapter III thereof, in particular through releasing financial resources to support specific projects conducted by multilateral institutions, such as the OPCW. Accordingly, on 23 March 2012, the Council adopted Decision 2012/166/CFSP\u00a0(1) in support of activities of the OPCW.\n(10) On 21 November 2013, the Director-General of OPCW made a request to the Union for a contribution to the Trust Fund for Syria.\n(11) The technical implementation of this Decision should be entrusted to the OPCW. The projects as supported by the Union can only be financed through voluntary contributions to the OPCW Trust Fund. Such contributions to be provided by the Union will be instrumental in enabling the OPCW to fulfil the tasks as indicated in the relevant OPCW Executive Council Decisions of 27 September and 15 November 2013, and in UNSCR 2118 of 27 September 2013.\n(12) The supervision of the proper implementation of the Union's financial contribution should be entrusted to the Commission,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union shall support the OPCW activities by contributing to costs associated with the inspection and verification of the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons, as well as costs associated with activities complementary to the core mandated tasks in support of UNSCR 2118 (2013) and the OPCW Executive Council Decision of 27 September 2013 on the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons and subsequent and related resolutions and decisions.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The project supported through this Council Decision is the provision of situation-awareness products related to the security of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, including the status of the road network through the delivery to OPCW of satellite imagery and related information products of the EU Satellite Centre (EU SATCEN).\nA detailed description of the project is set out in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (the \u2018HR\u2019) shall be responsible for the implementation of this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The technical implementation of the activities referred to in Article 1(2) shall be entrusted to the OPCW.
