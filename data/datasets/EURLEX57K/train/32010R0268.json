However, even where Member States apply those exceptions, they should be free to state measures, such as security measures, that the Community institutions and bodies have to take in order to still be allowed to get access to these data sets and services.\n(4) Any agreement, including licence agreements, contracts and exchanges of e-mails or any other arrangement on access by the Community institutions and bodies to spatial data sets and services of the Member States and their public authorities under this Regulation, should use the terminology defined in Article 3 of the Directive 2007/2/EC.\n(5) In order to fulfil their public tasks and contribute to the implementation of the European policies related to the environment the Community institutions and bodies should be able to make spatial data sets and services available to contractors working on their behalf.\n(6) As a general requirement arrangements should comply with this Regulation from eighteen months after its entry into force.
