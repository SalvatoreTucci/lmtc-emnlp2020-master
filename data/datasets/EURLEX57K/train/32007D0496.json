Areas A and B in Germany can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(6) The interim protective measures provided for in Decisions 2007/434/EC and 2007/483/EC need now to be confirmed. In addition, the epidemiological situation of the avian influenza outbreak in poultry in the Czech Republic requires a modification of the restricted areas and of the duration of the measures.\n(7) Furthermore, Hungary and the United Kingdom have notified to the Commission that all control measures in relation to outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 on their territories have been ceased by 12 March 2007 and therefore the measures established in accordance with Article 4(2) for areas A and B are no longer necessary.\n(8) Decision 2006/415/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 July 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.
