The last update of the lean meat equation of the grading apparatus and the \u2018Zwei-Punkt-Me\u00dfverfahren\u2019 (ZP) method dates back to 1995.\n(3) Germany has requested the Commission to authorise the replacement of the formulas used in the \u2018General Electric Logiq 200pro\u2019, the \u2018Autofom I\u2019 and \u2018Zwei-Punkt-Me\u00dfverfahren\u2019 (ZP) methods of grading pig carcasses as well as to authorise two new methods for grading pig carcasses on its territory and has presented a detailed description of the dissection trial, indicating the principles on which that method is based, the results of its dissection trial and the equations used for assessing the percentage of lean meat in the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcasses and the reporting of prices thereof\u00a0(3).\n(4) Examination of that request has revealed that the conditions for authorising those grading methods are fulfilled. Those grading methods should therefore be authorised in Germany.\n(5) Decision 89/471/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In view of the technical circumstances while introducing new devices and new equations, the methods for grading pig carcasses authorised under this Decision should apply from 4 October 2011.\n(7) Modifications of the apparatus or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Decision.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Decision 89/471/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.

The lean meat content of the carcass shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nLMP = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 centimetres off the midline of the split carcass, between the second and third last ribs,\nx2 = the thickness of the dorsal muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x1.\n(2) in Part II (Zwei-Punkt-Me\u00dfverfahren (ZP)), point 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182. The lean meat content of carcases shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nLMP = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nF \u2014 fat measure, the minimum thickness of visible fat (including rind) covering the M. glutaeus medius on the midline of the split carcass (mm),\nM \u2014 meat measure, measured at the shortest connection between the front (cranial) end of the M. glutaeus medius and the upper (dorsal) edge of the vertebral canal (mm).\n(3) Part III (Fully automatic ultrasonic carcase grading (Autofom)) is replaced by the following:\n1. The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cAutofom I\u201d.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with 16 2\u00a0MHz ultrasonic transducers (Carometec A/S), with an operating distance between transducers of 25\u00a0mm.\n3. The lean meat content of carcasses shall be calculated on the basis of 31 variables according to the following formula:\nLMP = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nIP001, IP002, IP007\u2026IP122 are the variables measured by Autofom I.\n4. The lean meat content of carcasses may also be calculated on the basis of 3\u00a0t-values (principal component variables) according to the following formula:\nLMP = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nT1, T2, T3 = the principal component variables calculated on the basis of the 31 variables of paragraph 3.\n5.

The CSB Image-Meater consists in particular of a video camera, a PC equipped with an image-analysis card, a screen, a printer, a command mechanism, a rate mechanism and interfaces. The 3 Image-Meater variables are all measured at the split line in the ham area (around M. gluteus medius):\n3.
