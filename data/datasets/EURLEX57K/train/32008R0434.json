France indicated in particular in its statement of opposition that registration of the designation \u2018Cordero de Navarra\u2019 or \u2018Nafarroako Arkumea\u2019 would prejudice the existence of products legally on the market whose registration as a protected geographical indication, i.e. \u2018Agneau de lait des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es\u2019 has been undergoing examination by the French authorities since 2000. The geographical area covered by this request for registration includes the historical region of Basse Navarre, an area also known as \u2018Navarre fran\u00e7aise\u2019 (French Navarre).\n(3) By way of a letter dated 22 May 2007 the Commission invited the interested parties to hold appropriate consultations with each other.\n(4) Given that no agreement was reached between Spain and France within a time frame of six months, the Commission must adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure outlined in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. In the light of the information provided by France, the Commission cannot conclude that registration of \u2018Cordero de Navarra\u2019 or \u2018Nafarroako Arkumea\u2019 would harm the rights of producers of \u2018Agneau de lait des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es\u2019. It is impossible to tell from the statement of objection that the production of lamb in the historical area of Basse Navarre is marketed using the term \u2018Navarre\u2019.\n(5) In the light of this information, the designation \u2018Cordero de Navarra\u2019 or \u2018Nafarroako Arkumea\u2019 should be registered in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,", "main_body": ["The designation contained in the Annex to this Regulation shall be entered in the register.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 May 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
