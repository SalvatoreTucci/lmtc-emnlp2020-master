The following paragraph shall be added to Article 9:\n'4c. During the 1988/89 to 1990/91 marketing years, adjustment aid shall be granted, as an intervention measure, to the refining industry in Portugal for raw sugar imported from third countries under Article 303 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal and refined into white sugar in Portugal.\nThis aid shall be granted only if the imported raw sugar is refined into white sugar in the refineries referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 4. The aid for the white sugar in question shall be ECU 0,08 per 100 kilograms, expressed as white sugar.\nThis adjustment aid may be altered, for a given marketing year, in the light of the amount of the storage levy fixed for that year and/or to take account of a change in refiners' margins which results from the price review for that marketing year.'\n2.
