PROCEDURE  (1) In March 1993 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the Committee of the Wool Textile Industry in the EEC on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the Community production of the product concerned. The  complaint contained evidence of dumping and injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European  Communities (2) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of hand-knitting yarn of man-made synthetic staple fibres put up for retail sale, falling within CN codes 5511 10 00 and 5511 20 00.\n(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned and the Community producers. The parties concerned were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing, to request a hearing and to answer the  questionnaires addressed to them seeking the information the Commission deemed necessary for the assessment of dumping and injury. Several Community producers and exporters requested and were granted an extension of the time limit for replies set by the  Commission. However, the majority of the complaining Community producers did not reply to the questionnaire or supply the information requested by the Commission within the extended time limits.\n(3) The Commission considers that the information made available by some Community producers is not representative of the Community industry within the meaning of Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. As a result the allegations of injury  contained in the complaint could not be further investigated and verified. Therefore, the Commission considers that it is not possible to make a determination of injury or threat of injury with respect to the Community industry concerned.\nB. TERMINATION OF PROCEEDING  (4) In view of the circumstances set out at points 2 and 3 the Commission concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain synthetic hand-knitting yarn, originating in Turkey, should be terminated  forthwith.\n(5) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection.\n(6) The Committee of the Wool Textile Industry of the EEC was informed of the Commission's reasons for terminating the proceeding and did not comment,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of synthetic hand-knitting yarn falling within CN codes 5511 10 00 and 5511 20 00, originating in Turkey, is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 February 1994.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 209, 2. 8. 1988, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No C 210, 4. 8. 1993, p. 4."}
