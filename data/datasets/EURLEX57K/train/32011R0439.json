That derogation expired on 31 December 2010.\n(2) By Commission Regulation (EU) No 894/2010\u00a0(4) Cape Verde was granted an increase in the quantities provided for in 2010 in respect of two of the three categories of fishery products covered by Regulation (EC) No 815/2008. The quantities of the derogation were raised accordingly to 2\u00a0500 tonnes for prepared or preserved mackerel fillets and to 875 tonnes for prepared or preserved frigate tuna or frigate mackerel fillets.\n(3) By letter dated 21 October 2010 Cape Verde submitted a request for a prolongation of the said derogation. By letters dated 3 and 21 December 2010, and 14 January 2011 it submitted additional information in support of this request.\n(4) The request is for a prolongation for 1 year and a volume of 2\u00a0500 tonnes for prepared or preserved mackerel fillets and 875 tonnes for prepared or preserved frigate tuna or frigate mackerel.\n(5) Between 2008 and 2010 the total annual quantities originally granted contributed to a significant extent to improving the situation in the fishery processing sector and, to a certain extent, to the revitalisation of Cape Verde\u2019s artisanal fleet, which is of vital importance for that country. However, fully revitalising the Cape Verdean fleet to the degree envisaged requires a further increase in available capacity to provide enough originating raw materials to Cape Verde\u2019s fish processing industries.\n(6) The request demonstrates that, without the derogation, the ability of the Cape Verdean fish processing industry to continue to export to the Union would be significantly affected, which might deter further development of the Cape Verdean fleet for small pelagic fishing.\n(7) The derogation serves to give Cape Verde sufficient time to prepare itself to comply with the rules for the acquisition of preferential origin. Time is needed to ensure that the efforts to revitalise the local fishing fleet continue and Cape Verde thereby improves its ability to supply the local fishery processing sector with originating fish.\n(8) Since the prolongation is requested for a period starting on 1 January 2011, in order to ensure continuity of imports from Cape Verde to the Union, a new derogation should be granted with retroactive effect as of 1 January 2011.\n(9) In order to allow the temporary derogation to be limited to the time needed for Cape Verde to achieve compliance with the rules, the derogation should be granted for a period of 1 year in respect of 2\u00a0500 tonnes for prepared or preserved mackerel fillets and 875 tonnes for prepared or preserved frigate tuna or frigate mackerel.\n(10) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 lays down rules relating to the management of tariff quotas. In order to ensure efficient management conducted in close cooperation between the authorities of Cape Verde, the customs authorities of the Union and the Commission, those rules should apply mutatis mutandis to the quantities imported under the derogation granted by this Regulation.\n(11) In order to allow more efficient monitoring of the operation of the derogation, it is necessary to lay down the obligation for the authorities of Cape Verde, in accordance with Article 89(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, to communicate regularly to the Commission details of the certificates of origin Form A which have been issued.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Articles 72, 73, 75 to 79 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, prepared or preserved mackerel, frigate tuna and frigate mackerel of CN codes 1604\u00a015\u00a011 and ex\u00a01604\u00a019\u00a098 produced in Cape Verde from non-originating fish shall be regarded as originating in Cape Verde in accordance with the arrangements set out in Articles 2, 3 and 4 of this Regulation.", "The derogation provided for in Article 1 shall apply to products exported from Cape Verde and declared for free circulation in the Union, where the conditions specified in Article 74 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 are satisfied, during the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011, up to the quantities listed in the Annex against each product imported.", "The quantities set out in the Annex to this Regulation shall be managed in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The customs authorities of Cape Verde shall take the necessary steps to carry out quantitative checks on exports of the products referred to in Article 1.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following shall be entered in box 4 of certificate of origin Form A issued by the competent authorities of Cape Verde pursuant to this Regulation: \u2018Derogation \u2014 Regulation (EU) No 439/2011\u2019.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authorities of Cape Verde shall forward to the Commission every quarter a statement of the quantities in respect of which certificates of origin Form A have been issued pursuant to this Regulation and the serial numbers of those certificates.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It shall apply from 1 January 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 19.10.1992, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 220, 15.8.2008, p. 11.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 266, 9.10.2010, p. 39.\nANNEX\nOrder No CN code Description of goods Period Quantity (in tonnes net weight)\n09.1647 1604\u00a015\u00a011 Mackerel (Scomber Colias, Scomber Japonicus, Scomber Scombrus) fillets, prepared or preserved 1.1.2011 to 31.12.2011 2\u00a0500\n09.1648 ex\u00a01604\u00a019\u00a098 Frigate tuna, Frigate mackerel (Auxis thazard, Auxis Rochei) fillets, prepared or preserved 1.1.2011 to 31.12.2011 875"}
