Public procurement policy should also contribute to the achievement of common societal goals, including the fight against climate change and the promotion of innovation, which are important new challenges facing Europe.\n(3) Within this context, the framework created by Commission Decision 87/305/EEC, of 26 May 1987, setting up an advisory committee on the opening-up of public procurement\u00a0(1), is no longer suitable for providing the Commission with the expertise and practical input needed in order to shape a public procurement policy which meets the evolving challenges of the Union's public procurement policy.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to set up a group of experts on public procurement within a new legal framework which will allow, on the one hand, to adapt the functioning of the group to the new Commission framework for expert groups\u00a0(2), and, on the other hand, to provide the Commission with the necessary expertise, experience and insight in order to meet the new challenges in the field of public procurement.\n(5) The group should therefore help the Commission to develop high quality procurement debate and policy. The group shall, where appropriate, prepare reports or issue opinions to help the Commission in developing and implementing Union policy and legislation on public procurement.\n(6) Furthermore, such a forum would also enable the sectors concerned to be informed about the design and application of Union rules on procurement.\n(7) In view of the above, the group should have a mixed composition of members chosen on the basis of their personal capacity and/or of the interests they represent, and from organisations. Those members should come from different backgrounds including, for instance, legal practitioners, technical experts involved in procurement contracts, academia, industry or trade organisations, associations of contracting authorities or entities.\n(8) The composition of the group should be balanced both with regard to gender and geographical origin as far as possible.\n(9) All members should satisfy high standards of active and quality participation during the meetings and in their preparation and follow up if needed.\n(10) Personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\n(11) Therefore, Decision 87/305/EEC should be repealed,", "main_body": ["Commission stakeholder expert group on public procurement\nA stakeholder expert group on public procurement (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the group\u2019) is hereby set up.\nThis group replaces the advisory committee on the opening-up of public procurement set up by Decision 87/305/EEC.", "Tasks of the group\nThe tasks of the group shall be to provide the Commission with high quality legal, economic, technical and/or practical insight and expertise with a view to assisting it in shaping the public procurement policy of the Union.\nThose tasks may involve:\n(a) providing legal and economic analysis and comments on important developments or structural trends of public procurement, and their implications for the Union policy framework;\n(b) providing feedback to the Commission services on the challenges and developments in specific sectors which may require public procurement response and to propose adequate solutions;\n(c) providing input aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Union's public procurement policy;\n(d) providing input in the framework of preparatory legislative work of the Commission in the field of public procurement;\n(e) assisting the Commission services in analysing the relevant case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nThe opinions of the group shall not be binding on the Commission or its services.", "Consultation\nThe Commission or its services may consult the group on any matter relating to the Union's public procurement policy, law and practice.", "Membership \u2014 Appointment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The group shall be composed of a maximum of 20 members.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Members shall be individuals appointed in a personal capacity, individuals representing a common interest, and/or organisations as referred to in Rule 8 of the horizontal rules for Commission expert groups.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All members and their representatives shall satisfy high standards of active and quality participation during the meetings and in their preparation and follow up if needed.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A call for applications shall be published by the services of the Commission with a view to selecting the members of the group.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Members shall be appointed by the Director General of DG Internal Market and Services.
