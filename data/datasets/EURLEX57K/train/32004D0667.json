Due to the complexity of the model and the need for experience both in statistics and veterinary epidemiology, two experts per Member States should be invited. In an initial stage, expert assistance from the CRL might also be needed when Member States are using the model in the assessment of their own surveillance programmes. Therefore the Community financial assistance to the annual work plan of the CRL should be increased to cover the additional costs for this workshop and expert assistance.\n(4) Rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 156/2004 of 29 January 2004 on the Community\u2019s financial assistance to the Community reference laboratories pursuant to Article 28 of Decision 90/424/EEC\u00a0(3).\n(5) Decision 2004/145/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/145/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
