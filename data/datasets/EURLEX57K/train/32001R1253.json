The rules also provide for a reduction of the amounts allocated to Member States in subsequent financial years where that Member State has not actually incurred the expenditure allocated to it in the current financial year.\n(4) During the first year of application of the restructuring and conversion system, certain Member States have had difficulties in setting up and applying the system. Application of the rules in Article 16 and 17 would lead to excessive reductions in the amounts available for restructuring and conversion in those Member States in the current and next financial year. In other Member States, these difficulties have been less severe but mean that they will be unable to spend their entire allocation by 30 June, but should be able to do so by 15 October.\n(5) Therefore it is appropriate, on a transitional basis for the 2000-01 financial year, to mitigate these excessive reductions by providing for the possibility to recycle expenditure not actually incurred by 30 June 2001 to Member States who have not yet fully incurred their allocation by that date, within an appropriate limit.\n(6) It is also appropriate, on a transitional basis for the 2000-01 financial year, to provide for the possibility to recycle expenditure not actually incurred by 30 June 2001 to Member States which have spent a significant proportion of their allocation, within the limit of their initial allocation.\n(7) In order that Member States can make the requests foreseen in this Regulation, it is necessary that it enters into force by 30 June 2001 at the latest.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["The following paragraph is added to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000: \"8.
