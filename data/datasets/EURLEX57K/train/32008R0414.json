The fragmented production of such cheeses further aggravates the consequences of that seasonality. Therefore, provision should be made for recourse to seasonal storage in respect of a quantity corresponding to the difference between summer and winter production.\n(3) The types of cheeses eligible for aid and the maximum quantities which may qualify for it should be laid down, as well as the duration of the contracts in relation to the real requirements of the market and the keeping qualities of the cheeses in question.\n(4) It is necessary to specify the terms of the storage contract and the essential measures to enable the cheese covered by a contract to be identified and subjected to checks. The amount of aid should be fixed taking into account the storage costs and the balance to be maintained between cheeses qualifying for the aid and other cheeses marketed. In view of these elements, and of the available resources, the total amount of aid should not be changed.\n(5) Detailed rules should also be laid down regarding documentation, accounting and the frequency and nature of checks. In this connection, it should be laid down that the Member States may charge the costs of checks fully or in part to the contractor.\n(6) It should be clarified that only whole cheeses are eligible for the private storage aid.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the detailed rules for granting Community aid for private storage of certain cheeses (hereinafter referred to as aid) pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 during the 2008/09 storage period.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation:\n(a) \u2018storage lot\u2019 means a quantity of cheese weighing at least 2 tonnes, of the same type and taken into storage in a single storage depot on a single day;\n(b) \u2018day of commencement of contractual storage\u2019 means the day following that of entry into storage;\n(c) \u2018last day of contractual storage\u2019 means the day before that of removal from storage;\n(d) \u2018storage period\u2019 means the period during which the cheese can be covered by the private storage scheme, as specified for each type of cheese in the Annex.", "Cheeses eligible for aid\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aid shall be granted in respect of certain long-keeping cheeses, Pecorino Romano, Kefalotyri and Kasseri cheese under the terms laid down in the Annex.
