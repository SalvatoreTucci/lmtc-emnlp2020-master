During the period referred to in Article 36 of Regulation (EEC)  No 1785/81, the shortfall referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 37 (3) of that  Regulation shall be fixed for each marketing year or part thereof, on the basis of a Community  forecast supply balance for raw sugar. For the purposes of determining that balance, the  established direct consumption to be taken into account shall not exceed the limit for such  consumption referred to in Article 37 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/81.\n2.  The shortfall may be imported by opening tariff quotas at a special reduced rate of duty agreed  with the States referred to in Article 33 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 and other States.
