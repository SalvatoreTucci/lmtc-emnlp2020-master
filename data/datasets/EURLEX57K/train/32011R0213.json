These training programmes are regulated by the Healthcare and Nursing Special Task Ordinance (GuK-SV BGBl II No 452/2005) and the Healthcare and Nursing Teaching and Management Duties Ordinance (GuK-LFV BGBl II No 453/2005).\n(2) As these Austrian training programmes are of an equivalent level of training to that provided for under Article 11(c)(i) of Directive 2005/36/EC and provide a comparable professional standard and prepare the trainee for a comparable level of responsibilities and functions, their inclusion on the basis of Article 11(c)(ii) in Annex II to Directive 2005/36/EC is justified.\n(3) Portugal has submitted a reasoned request to include in point 5.1.3 of Annex V to Directive 2005/36/EC specialist medical training in medical oncology.\n(4) Medical oncology aims at offering a systemic treatment of cancer. The treatment of cancer patients has undergone major changes over the last decade due to scientific progress. Specialist medical training in medical oncology is not listed in point 5.1.3 of Annex V to Directive 2005/36/EC. However, medical oncology has developed into a separate and distinct specialist medical training in more than two fifths of the Member States, which justifies its inclusion into point 5.1.3 of Annex V to Directive 2005/36/EC.\n(5) In order to ensure a sufficiently high level of specialist medical training, the minimum period of training required for the medical specialty of medical oncology to be automatically recognised should be five years.\n(6) France has submitted a reasoned request to include in point 5.1.3 of Annex V to Directive 2005/36/EC specialist medical training in medical genetics.\n(7) Medical genetics is a specialty that responds to the rapid development of knowledge in the field of genetics and its implication in numerous specialised fields, such as oncology, foetal medicine, paediatrics, chronic diseases. Medical genetics plays a growing role in screening and in the prevention of numerous pathologies. Specialist medical training in medical genetics is not listed in point 5.1.3 of Annex V to Directive 2005/36/EC. However, it has developed into a separate and distinct specialist medical training in more than two fifths of the Member States, which justifies its inclusion into point 5.1.3 of Annex V to Directive 2005/36/EC.\n(8) In order to ensure a sufficiently high level of specialist medical training, the minimum period of training required for the medical specialty of medical genetics to be automatically recognised should be four years.\n(9) Directive 2005/36/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and V to Directive 2005/36/EC are amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 March 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 22.\nANNEX\nAnnexes II and V to Directive 2005/36/EC are amended as follows:\n1. in point 1 of Annex II, under \u2018in Austria\u2019, the following is added:\n\u2018\u2014 special training in the care of children and young people (Sonderausbildung in der Kinder- und Jugendlichenpflege),\n\u2014 special training in psychiatric healthcare and nursing (Sonderausbildung in der psychiatrischen Gesundheits- und Krankenpflege),\n\u2014 special training in intensive care (Sonderausbildung in der Intensivpflege),\n\u2014 special training in intensive care of children (Sonderausbildung in der Kinderintensivpflege),\n\u2014 special training in anaesthesia-related nursing (Sonderausbildung in der An\u00e4sthesiepflege),\n\u2014 special training in renal replacement therapy related nursing (Sonderausbildung in der Pflege bei Nierenersatztherapie),\n\u2014 special training in operating department nursing (Sonderausbildung in der Pflege im Operationsbereich),\n\u2014 special training in hospital hygiene (Sonderausbildung in der Krankenhaushygiene),\n\u2014 special training for teaching tasks in healthcare and nursing (Sonderausbildung f\u00fcr Lehraufgaben in der Gesundheits- und Krankenpflege),\n\u2014 special training for management tasks in healthcare and nursing.
