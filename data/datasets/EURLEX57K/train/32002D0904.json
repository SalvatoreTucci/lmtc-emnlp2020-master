He will also support public information and awareness programmes connected with that law.\n2. For the purposes of Article 1(2)(b), the Project Manager, in cooperation with the Cambodian armed forces, will continue the work related to record keeping and the management and security of weapons stocks and to developing policies, guidelines and practices in this area.

He will ensure, if a further project is implemented, that the relevant authorities are closely involved in defining and carrying through the new project.\nFor the same purposes, but in relation to the police force, the Project manager will, in close cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior, implement a pilot project on record keeping, stockpile management and the security of weapons stocks as recommended in the feasibility study carried out by the EU ASAC police expert in 2002.

The Project Manager will continue to supervise and monitor implementation of voluntary weapons surrender programmes (Weapons for Development), both large-scale programmes such as were carried out previously in Kratie and Pursat, and small-scale programmes being implemented by local NGO's in several provinces.\n4. For the purposes of Article 1(2)(d), the Project manager will allocate financial aid to support activities by non-governmental organisations in Cambodia, including the coalition \"Working Group for Weapons Reduction in Cambodia\", such as awareness training, information sharing and education and training programmes. These activities may take place in selected regions in Cambodia, as agreed between the Project Manager and the relevant organisations.

The Project Manager will ensure that appropriate procedures re-established for effective monitoring and evaluation of activities.
