Applications have been submitted for the renewal of these active substances. As the requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012 of 18 September 2012 setting out the provisions necessary for the implementation of the renewal procedure for active substances as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market\u00a0(3) will apply to those active substances, it is necessary to allow sufficient time to complete the renewal procedure in accordance with that Regulation. Consequently, the approval of those active substances would be likely to expire before a decision has been taken on their renewal. It is therefore necessary to postpone the expiry of their approval periods.\n(3) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) In view of the aim of the first paragraph of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as regards cases where no supplementary dossier in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012 is submitted within 30 months before the respective expiry date laid down in the Annex to this Regulation, the Commission will set the expiry date at the same date as before this Regulation or at the earliest date thereafter.\n(5) In view of the aim of the first paragraph of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as regards cases where the Commission will adopt a Regulation providing that the approval of an active substance referred to in the Annex to this Regulation is not renewed because the approval criteria are not satisfied, the Commission will set the expiry date at the same date as before this Regulation or at the date of the adoption of the Regulation providing that the approval of the active substance is not renewed, whichever date is later.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in
