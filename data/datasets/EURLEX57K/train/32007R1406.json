The application was lodged by Fuyang Genebest Chemical Industry Co. Ltd (\u2018the applicant\u2019), an exporting producer in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u2018the country concerned\u2019).\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRODUCT\n(2) The product under review is tartaric acid originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u2018the product concerned\u2019), currently classifiable within CN code 2918\u00a012\u00a000. This CN code is given only for information.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXISTING MEASURES\n(3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 130/2006\u00a0(2) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, including the product concerned produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 34,9\u00a0% with the exception of several companies specially mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW\n(4) The applicant alleges that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively claims individual treatment in conformity with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 (\u2018the original investigation period\u2019) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the above mentioned anti-dumping measures.\n(5) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.\n(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a \u2018new exporter\u2019 review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively whether the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation and, if so, the applicant\u2019s individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.\n(8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 130/2006.\n(a) Questionnaires\n(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(c) Market economy status\n(d) Selection of the market economy country\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS\n(9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicants, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant\u2019s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(10) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n(a) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in Article 4(1) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation;\n(b) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission;\n(c) interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of Argentina which, in the event that the applicant will not be granted market economy treatment, is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People\u2019s Republic of China;\n(d) the applicant should submit a duly substantiated claim for market economy treatment.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON CO-OPERATION\n(11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(12) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\nJ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(13) It is noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of your rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of DG Trade.
