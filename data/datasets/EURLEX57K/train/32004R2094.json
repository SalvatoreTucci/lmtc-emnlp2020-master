This Regulation provides for management through import licences, for which applications are submitted monthly.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(3) codifies the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations and for surveillance of preferential imports.\n(4) With a view to simplification and given the small volume of the tariff quota for oat grains otherwise worked falling within CN code 1104\u00a022\u00a098, Regulation (EC) No 2454/93 should be applied to the management of this quota from the 2005/06 marketing year on, and Regulation (EC) No 2369/96 should be repealed. For administrative reasons a new serial number must be introduced for the quota in question.\n(5) Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 provides for an exemption from the requirement to submit an import licence for products having no significant appreciable impact on the supply situation of the cereals market. The Community annually imports an average of 6\u00a0000 tonnes of oat grains otherwise worked falling within CN code 1104\u00a022\u00a098. This involves a limited quantity of very specific products for industrial use, with no impact on the cereals market. The exemption from the import licence requirement provided for in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 can therefore be applied.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The tariff quota in the Annex is hereby opened for each marketing year running from 1 July to 30 June.", "The tariff quota referred to in Article 1 shall be managed by the Commission in accordance with the Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.", "Imports of oat grains under the tariff quota referred to in Article 1 shall not require the submission of an import licence.", "Regulation (EC) No 2369/96 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 323, 13.12.1996, p. 8.
