The EIB applies in this case as in all other cases best banking practices to its lending under the Community guarantee, including not entering into new commitments involving borrowers or guarantors who fall into arrears in their obligations for debt to the EIB.\n(8) The FRY has, in October 2001, cleared all its arrears outstanding as of that date towards the European Communities and the EIB.\nFurthermore, the FRY Parliament has, in September 2001, ratified an agreement with the EIB, whereby the FRY has assumed responsibility for all financial obligations of all public entities of the FRY towards the EIB that are not yet due.\n(9) On 31 October 1994 the Council adopted Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions(2).\n(10) The global guarantee covering the general EIB external lending mandate laid down in Council Decision 2000/24/EC of 22 December 1999 granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects outside the Community (Central and Eastern Europe, Mediterranean countries, Latin America and Asia and the Republic of South Africa)(3) should be extended to the FRY and the loan ceilings increased. Decision 2000/24/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers other than those under Article 308,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Decision 2000/24/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the second sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be amended as follows:\n(a) in the introductory phrase \"EUR 19110 million\" shall be replaced by \"EUR 19460 million\";\n(b) in the first indent \"EUR 8930 million\" shall be replaced by \"EUR 9280 million\";\n2. in the first indent of paragraph 2, \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" shall be inserted after \"Estonia\".", "This Decision shall take effect on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2001.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
