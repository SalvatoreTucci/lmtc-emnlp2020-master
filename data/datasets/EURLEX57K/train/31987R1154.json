whereas it is necessary to open this Community tariff quota for the period in question;\nWhereas, in accordance with Articles 180 and 367 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, the Council adopted Regulation (EEC) No 449/86 determining the arrangements to be applied by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to trade with certain third countries (3); whereas this Regulation therefore applies to the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;\nWhereas it is in particular necessary to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, calculated by reference to the statistics for imports from Cyprus over a representative reference period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;\nWhereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, the corresponding imports by each of the Member States represent the following percentages of the imports into the Community from Cyprus of the products concerned:\n1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Member States  // 1983   // 1984  // 1985   //    //   //   //   // Benelux   // 6,2   // 6,2  // 2,7   // Denmark   // -   // -   // -   // Germany   // 1,9   // 4,0   // 2,8   // Greece   // -   // -   // -   // France  // -   // -   // -   // Ireland   // 0,2   // 0,8   // 1,3  // Italy   // -   // -   // -   // United Kingdom   // 91,7  // 89,0   // 93,2   //    //   //   //\nWhereas, in view of these factors of market forecasts for the products in question and in particular of the estimates submitted by certain Member States, initial quota shares may be fixed approximately at the following percentages:\nBenelux 5,0\nDenmark 0,1\nGermany 2,9\nGreece 0,1\nFrance 0,1\nIreland 0,6\nItaly 0,1\nUnited Kingdom 91,1\nWhereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota amount should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among the Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover at a later date the requirements of the Member States which have used up their initial quota shares; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota should under the circumstances be fixed at 91 % of the quota volume;\nWhereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial quota share should draw an additional share from the corresponding reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States thereof;\nWhereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a substantial quantity remains unused in any Member State, it is essential that that Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve to prevent a part of any tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
