The following two procedures are to be applied:\nA. The arithmetical mean of the five results obtained is compared with the declared fat content. The declared fat content is deemed to comply if the arithmetical mean content does not differ by more than one percentage point from the declared fat content.\nB. The five individual results are compared with the tolerance (\u00c2\u0105 two percentage points of the declared fat content) shown in Article 2(1)(b). If the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the five individual results is less than or equal to four percentage points, the requirements of Article 2(1)(b) are deemed to be met.\nWhere compliance with the conditions set out under A and B is established, the batch being checked is deemed to comply with the requirements of Article 2(1)(b) even where one of the five values falls outside the tolerance range of \u00c2\u0105 two percentage points.`", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 November 1998.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 316, 9. 12. 1994, p. 2.\n(2) OJ L 182, 3. 7. 1987, p. 36.\n(3) OJ L 87, 2. 4. 1997, p. 3.\n(4) OJ L 180, 24. 6. 1998, p. 5."}
