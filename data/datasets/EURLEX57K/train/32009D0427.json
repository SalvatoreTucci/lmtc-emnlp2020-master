In particular, the European action plan for organic food and farming recommends, in action 11, establishing an independent expert panel for technical advice.\n(3) The Commission may need technical advice to decide on the authorisation of the use of products, substances and techniques in organic farming and processing, to develop or improve organic production rules and, more in general, for any other matter relating to the area of organic production.
