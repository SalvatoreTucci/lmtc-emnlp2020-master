DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to melons of varieties (cultivars) grown from Cucumis melo L. to be supplied fresh to the consumer, melons for industrial processing being excluded.\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements of melons, after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the melons must be:\n- intact (1),\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- clean, practically free from any visible foreign matter,\n- fresh in appearance,\n- practically free from pests,\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n- firm,\n- free of abnormal external moisture,\n- free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\nThe melons must be sufficiently developed and display satisfactory ripeness (2). The development and condition of the melons must be such as to enable them:\n- to withstand transport and handling, and\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB. Classification\nMelons are classified in two classes defined below:\n(i) Class I\nMelons in this class must be of good quality. They must be characteristic of the variety or commercial type.\nThe following slight defects, however, may be allowed provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the keeping quality and presentation in the package:\n- a slight defect in shape,\n- a slight defect in colouring (a pale colouring of the rind at the point where the fruit touched the ground while growing is not regarded as a defect),\n- slight skin blemishes due to rubbing or handling,\n- slight healed cracks around the peduncle of less than 2 cm in length that do not reach the pulp.\nThe length of the penduncle, in the case of fruit belonging to varieties that do not separate at the time of ripening, may not exceed 2 cm for the varieties of Charentais, Ogen and Galia type melons and 5 cm for other melons, but must in any case be present and intact.\n(ii) Class II\nThis class includes melons which do not qualify for inclusion in Class I but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\nThe following defects may be allowed provided the melons retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, the keeping quality and presentation\n- defects in shape,\n- defects in colouring (a pale colouring of the rind at the point where the fruit touched the ground while growing is not regarded as a defect),\n- slight bruising,\n- slight cracks or deep scratches that do not affect the pulp of the fruit and are dry,\n- skin blemishes due to rubbing or handling.\nIII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING\nSize is determined by the weight of one unit or by the diameter of the equatorial section.\nThe minimum sizes are as follows:\nSizing by weight:\n>TABLE>\nSizing by diameter:\n>TABLE>\nWhen the size is expressed in terms of weight, the largest melon in each package may not weigh over 50 % more than the smallest.\nWhen the size is expressed in terms of diameter, the diameter of the largest melon may not be over 20 % more than the diameter of the smallest.\nSizing is compulsory for both classes.\nIV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES\nTolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.\nA. Quality tolerances\n(i) Class I\n10 % by number or weight of melons not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting those of Class II or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances of that class.\n(ii) Class II\n10 % by number or weight of melons satisfying neither the requirements of the class, nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\nB. Size tolerances\nFor all classes: 10 % by number or weight of melons not satisfying the size immediately below or above that indicated on the package.\nV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION\nA. Uniformity\nThe contents of each package must be uniform and contain only melons of the same origin, variety or commercial type, quality and size, and which have reached appreciably the same degree of development and ripeness and are of appreciably the same colour.\nThe visible part of the contents of the package must be representative of the entire contents.\nB. Packaging\nMelons must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.\nThe materials used inside the package must be new, clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce. The use of materials, particularly of paper or stamps bearing trade specifications is allowed, provided the printing or labelling is done with non-toxic ink or glue.\nPackages must be free from all foreign matter.\nVI. PROVISIONS CONCERNING MARKING\nEach package must bear the following particulars in letters grouped on the same side, legibly and indelibly marked and visible from the outside:\nA. Identification\nPacker and/or dispatcher: name and address or officially issued or accepted code mark. However, in the case where a code mark is used, the reference 'packer` and/or 'dispatcher` (or equivalent abbreviations) have to be indicated in close connection to the code mark.\nB. Nature of produce\n- 'Melons` if the contents are not visible from the outside,\n- name of the variety or commercial type (e.g. Charentais).\nC. Origin of produce\n- country of origin and, optionally, national, regional or local place name.\nD. Commercial specifications\n- class,\n- size expressed in minimum and maximum weight or minimum and maximum diameter,\n- number of units (optional).\nE. Official control mark (optional)\n(1) However, a small healed scar caused by automatic measurement of the refractometric index is not regarded as a defect.\n(2) The refractometric index of the pulp must be at least 8 % measured at the middle point of the fruit flesh at the equatorial section.\nANNEX II\nSTANDARDS FOR WATERMELONS\nI. DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to watermelons of varieties (cultivars) grown from Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. et Nakai to be supplied fresh to the consumer, watermelons for industrial processing being excluded.\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements of watermelons after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the watermelons must be:\n- intact,\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- clean, practically free from any visible foreign matter,\n- practically free from pests,\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n- firm and sufficiently ripe; the colour and taste of the flesh should conform to a sufficient state of ripeness,\n- not split,\n- free from abnormal external moisture,\n- free from any foreign smell and/or taste.\nThe development and condition of the watermelons must be such as to enable them:\n- to withstand transport and handling, and\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB.
