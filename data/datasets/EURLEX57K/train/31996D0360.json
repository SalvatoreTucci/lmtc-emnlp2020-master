The coefficient is obtained by multiplying the milk production level recorded each month during the period by 50 % of the average monthly value of the milk production recorded from April to September prior to the start of the period in question.", "This Decision shall be reviewed two years following its adoption on the basis of a report presented to the Commission by the Irish authorities.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 June 1996.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 268, 14. 9. 1992, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 368, 31. 12. 1994, p. 33."}
