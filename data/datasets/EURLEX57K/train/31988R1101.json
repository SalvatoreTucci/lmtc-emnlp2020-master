Paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u00c2\u00b43. Where the production of soya beans, as estimated before the end of the second month of the marketing year, exceeds the maximum guaranteed quality for the beans concerned and for the marketing year in question, the amount of the aid for that  marketing year shall be reduced by the incidence on the guide price of a coefficient which reflects the extent of the difference.\nWhere the first subparagraph, when applied to actual production instead of estimated production at the beginning of the marketing year, would lead to a different reduction in the amount of the aid than that actually applied, the amount of aid for the  following marketing year shall be adjusted to take account of that situation.'
