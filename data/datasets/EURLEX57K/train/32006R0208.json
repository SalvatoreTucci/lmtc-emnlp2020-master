Category 3 material used as raw material in a composting plant must be submitted to the following minimum requirements:\n(a) maximum particle size before entering the composting reactor: 12\u00a0mm;\n(b) minimum temperature in all material in the reactor: 70\u00a0\u00b0C; and\n(c) minimum time in the reactor at 70\u00a0\u00b0C (all material): 60 minutes.\u2019\n(e) The following Point C(13a) is inserted:\n\u201813a. However, the competent authority may authorise the use of other standardised process parameters provided an applicant demonstrates that such parameters ensure minimising of biological risks. That demonstration shall include a validation, which shall be carried out in accordance with points (a) to (f):\n(a) Identification and analysis of possible hazards, including the impact of input material, based on a full definition of the processing conditions.\n(b) A risk assessment, which evaluates how the specific processing conditions referred to in (a) are achieved in practice under normal and atypical situations.\n(c) Validation of the intended process by measuring the reduction of viability/infectivity of:\n(i) endogenous indicator organisms during the process, where the indicator is:\n\u2014 consistently present in the raw material in high numbers,\n\u2014 not less heat resistant to the lethal aspects of the treatment process, but also not significantly more resistant than the pathogens for which it is being used to monitor,\n\u2014 relatively easy to quantify and relatively easy to identify and to confirm;\n(ii) a well-characterised test organism or virus, during exposure, introduced in a suitable test body into the starting material.\n(d) The validation of the intended process referred to in (c) must demonstrate that the process achieves the following overall risk reduction:\n(i) for thermal and chemical processes by:\n\u2014 reduction of 5 log10 of Enterococcus faecalis or Salmonella Senftenberg (775W, H2S negative),\n\u2014 reduction of infectivity titre of thermo resistant viruses such as parvovirus by at least 3 log10, whenever they are identified as a relevant hazard;\n(ii) as regards chemical processes also by:\n\u2014 reduction of resistant parasites such as eggs of ascaris sp. by at least 99,9\u00a0% (3 log10) of viable stages.\n(e) Designing a complete control programme including procedures for monitoring the functioning of the process referred to in (c).\n(f) Measures ensuring continuous monitoring and supervision of the relevant process parameters fixed in the control programme when operating the plant.\n(f) In point C(14), point (b) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) considers that the residues or compost are unprocessed material.\u2019\n(g) Point D(15) is replaced by the following:\n\u201815. Representative samples of the digestion residues or compost taken during or immediately after processing at the biogas or composting plant in order to monitor the process must comply with the following standards:\nn = number of samples to be tested;\nm = threshold value for the number of bacteria; the result is considered satisfactory if the number of bacteria in all samples does not exceed m;\nM = maximum value for the number of bacteria; the result is considered unsatisfactory if the number of bacteria in one or more samples is M or more; and\nc = number of samples the bacterial count of which may be between m and M, the sample still being considered acceptable if the bacterial count of the other samples is m or less.\n2. Annex VIII, Chapter III, Point II.A.(5) is replaced by the following:\n\u20185.

This demonstration shall include a validation, which shall be carried out as follows:\n(i) Identification and analysis of possible hazards including the impact of input material, based on a full definition of the processing conditions, and a risk assessment, which evaluates how the specific processing conditions are achieved in practice under normal and atypical situations.\n(ii) Validation of the intended process\n(ii-1) by measuring the reduction of viability/infectivity of endogenous indicator organisms during the process, where the indicator is:\n\u2014 consistently present in the raw material in high numbers,\n\u2014 not less heat resistant to the lethal aspects of the treatment process, but also not significantly more resistant than the pathogens for which it is being used to monitor,\n\u2014 relatively easy to quantify and relatively easy to identify and confirm;\n(ii-2) by measuring the reduction of viability/infectivity, during exposure, of a well-characterised test organism or virus introduced in a suitable test body into the starting material.\n(iii) The validation referred to in point (ii) must demonstrate that the process achieves the following overall risk reduction:\n\u2014 for thermal and chemical processes by reduction of Enterococcus faecalis by at least 5 log10 and by reduction of infectivity titre of thermo resistant viruses such as parvovirus, where they are identified as a relevant hazard, by at least 3 log10,\n\u2014 for chemical processes also by reduction of resistant parasites such as eggs of ascaris sp. by at least 99,9\u00a0% (3 log10) of viable stages.\n(iv) Designing a complete control programme including procedures for monitoring the process.\n(v) Measures ensuring continuous monitoring and supervision of the relevant process parameters fixed in the control programme when operating the plant.\n(d) Representative samples of the manure taken during or immediately after processing at the plant in order to monitor the process must comply with the following standards:\nn = number of samples to be tested;\nm = threshold value for the number of bacteria; the result is considered satisfactory if the number of bacteria in all samples does not exceed m;\nM = maximum value for the number of bacteria; the result is considered unsatisfactory if the number of bacteria in one or more samples is M or more; and\nc = number of samples the bacterial count of which may be between m and M, the sample still being considered acceptable if the bacterial count of the other samples is m or less.\n(e) They must be stored in such a way that once processed contamination or secondary infection and dampness is minimised. They must therefore be stored in:\n(i) well-sealed and insulated silos, or\n(ii) properly sealed packs (plastic bags or \u201cbig bags\u201d).\u2019"}
