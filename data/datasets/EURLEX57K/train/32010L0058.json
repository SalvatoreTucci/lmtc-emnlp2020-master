In order to support such an extension of the use, the notifier Devgen submitted additional information.\n(4) France has evaluated the information submitted and informed the Commission on 12 January 2010 about its conclusions that the requested extension of use does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the specific provisions for iprodione in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and in the Commission review report for that substance. In particular, France has prepared several addenda to the assessment report in the concerned areas of the risk assessment, whose conclusions confirm the acceptability of such extension of use.\n(5) Therefore, it is justified to modify the specific provisions for iprodione.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 24 December 2010 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
