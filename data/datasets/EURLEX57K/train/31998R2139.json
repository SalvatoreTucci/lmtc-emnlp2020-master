whereas the declarations of opposition deemed inadmissible either failed to show the grounds on which the opposition was based or did not relate to the comprehensive grounds for opposition laid down in paragraph 4 of that Article;\nWhereas in accordance with Article 7(5) of that Regulation and in view of the fact that French producers submitted a declaration of opposition, the Commission invited the Member State concerned to seek agreement; whereas, however, no agreement was reached and the Commission must accordingly decide on registration of the name in question;\nWhereas, with regard to a declaration of opposition from Danish producers, the Commission had to reconsider its position because of factors which had not come to light at the time the opposition was sent to the Commission; whereas that opposition should also be declared admissible;\nWhereas, under Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, as added by Council Regulation (EEC) No 535/97 (4), provision may be made for a transitional period of up to five years under Article 7(5)(b), where inter alia products exist (as in this case) which have been legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of the publication provided for in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92; whereas such transitional period may be provided for only where undertakings have legally marketed the products concerned using the names in question continuously for at least five years preceding the date of publication provided for in Article 6(2) of that Regulation; whereas the Member States in question state that these conditions have been fulfilled;\nWhereas in view of the arguments put forward by the parties concerned, a transitional period of three years is appropriate;

whereas those companies fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92;\nWhereas, as a result, this name should be entered in the 'Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications` and should therefore enjoy Community protection as a geographic indication;\nWhereas the Annex to this Regulation supplements the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 (5) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2008/98 (6);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee for Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin,", "main_body": ["The name in the Annex hereto is hereby added to the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 and is entered in the 'Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications` as a protected geographical indication (PGI) as provided for in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92.\nThe companies 'Salaisons du Pays d'Oc`, 'S\u00f8r-Wi A/S`, 'S\u00f8rwi A/S`, 'Suhls P\u00e5l\u00e6g A/S`, 'Steff-Houlberg`, 'Vestjyske Slagterier A.m.b.a.` and 'Danish Crown` may continue to market their product under the name 'Jambon de Bayonne` for a period of three years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
