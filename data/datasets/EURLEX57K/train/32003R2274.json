This quota must be opened and administered by the Commission.\n(2) It is necessary to keep an administration system which ensures that only products originating in Thailand may be imported under the quota. The issue of an import licence should therefore continue to be subject to the presentation of an export certificate issued by the Thai authorities, a specimen of which has been notified to the Commission.\n(3) Since imports to the Community market of the products concerned have traditionally been administered on the basis of a calendar year, this system should be retained. A quota must therefore be opened for 2004.\n(4) The import of products covered by CN codes 0714 10 10, 0714 10 91 and 0714 10 99 is subject to the presentation of an import licence in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(3), and with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(4).\n(5) In the light of past experience and taking into account that the Community concession provides for an overall quantity for four years with an annual maximum of 5500000 tonnes, it is advisable to maintain measures which, under certain conditions, either facilitate the release for free circulation of quantities of products exceeding those given in the import licences, or allow the difference between the figure given in the import licences and the smaller figure actually imported to be carried forward.\n(6) In order to ensure the correct application of the agreement, a system of strict and systematic controls is needed that take account of the information given on the Thai export certificates and the Thai authorities' procedures for issuing export certificates.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I OPENING OF THE QUOTA", "1.
