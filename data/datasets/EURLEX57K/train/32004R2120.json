Following the accession of the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia, the number of samples to be taken for those countries should be determined.\n(2) Article 12 determines the number of analyses to be performed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), including analyses of samples from Member states not yet equipped. A transitory period should be laid down to provide for the setting up and the organisation of proficient isotopic laboratories in those Member states.\n(3) Annexes I, II and III to Regulation (EC) No 2729/2000 draw up precise instructions for the processing, analysis and reporting of samples. To take account of experience and technical progress, those instructions should be updated.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2729/2000 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2729/2000 is amended as follows:\n1.

Each sample must consist of at least 10\u00a0kg of ripe grapes of the same variety. They are to be taken in the condition in which they are found.\nB. When the samples are taken, a description sheet is to be drawn up. This sheet must include a first part concerning the sampling of the grapes and a second part concerning vinification. It must be kept with the sample and must accompany it during all transportation. It must be kept up to date by means of an entry regarding each type of treatment undergone by the sample.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VINIFICATION\nA. Vinification must be carried out by the competent body or by a department authorised to do so by that body, wherever possible under conditions comparable with the normal conditions in the production area of which the sample is representative. Vinification should result in the total transformation of the sugar into alcohol, i.e. in less than 2\u00a0g/l of residual sugar. However, in certain cases, e.g. for ensuring a better representativity, higher amounts of residual sugars can be accepted. As soon as the wine has clarified and stabilised by means of SO2, it must be put in 75\u00a0cl bottles and labelled.\nB.
