However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.\n(3) For certain EU producers of sugar and isoglucose, exports from the Union represent an important part of their economic activities and they have established traditional markets outside the Union. Exports of sugar and isoglucose to those markets could be economically viable also without granting export refunds. To that end it is necessary to fix a quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose exports so that the EU producers concerned may continue to supply their traditional markets.\n(4) For the 2010/2011 marketing year it is estimated that fixing the quantitative limit initially at 650\u00a0000 tonnes, in white sugar equivalent, for out-of-quota sugar exports and 50\u00a0000 tonnes, in dry matter, for out-of-quota isoglucose would correspond to the market demand.\n(5) Exports of sugar from the Union to certain close destinations and to third countries granting EU products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favorable competitive position. In view of the absence of appropriate instruments of mutual assistance to fight against irregularities and in order to minimize the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or reintroduction into the Union of out-of-quota sugar certain close destinations should be excluded from the eligible destinations.\n(6) In view of the estimated lower risks for eventual frauds regarding isoglucose due to the nature of the product it is not necessary to restrict the eligible destinations for the export of out-of-quota isoglucose.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Fixing the quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar exports\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2010/2011 marketing year, running from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011, the quantitative limit referred to in Article 61, first paragraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be 650\u00a0000 tonnes for exports without refund of out-of-quota white sugar falling within CN code 1701\u00a099.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exports within the quantitative limit fixed in paragraph 1 shall be allowed for all destinations excluding:\n(a) third countries: Andorra, Liechtenstein, the Holy Seat (Vatican City State), San Marino, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia\u00a0(3), Montenegro, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia;\n(b) territories of Member States not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: the Faeroe Islands, Greenland, Heligoland, Ceuta, Melilla, the communes of Livigno and Campione d\u2019Italia, and the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control;\n(c) European territories for whose external relations a Member State is responsible, not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: Gibraltar.", "Fixing the quantitative limit for out-of-quota isoglucose exports\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2010/2011 marketing year, running from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011, the quantitative limit referred to in Article 61, first paragraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be 50\u00a0000 tonnes, in dry matter, for exports without refund of out-of-quota isoglucose falling within CN codes 1702\u00a040\u00a010, 1702\u00a060\u00a010 and 1702\u00a090\u00a030.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exports of the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall only be allowed where they comply with the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2010.\nIt shall expire on 30 September 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 May 2010.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nDacian CIOLO\u015e\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0178, 1.7.2006, p.\u00a024.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0As well as Kosovo under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999."}
