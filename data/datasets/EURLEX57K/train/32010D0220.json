These substances are in particular: chloramphenicol, nitrofurans, and tetracyclines. Measures should therefore be taken to mitigate that risk. The measures should be proportional and not restrict trade more than necessary in order to achieve a high level of consumer protection.\n(3) If a significant portion of the aquaculture products imported from Indonesia undergoes mandatory testing for relevant residues before they are placed on the market, this will reduce the risk that consignments containing residues are placed on the market, produce more precise information on the actual contamination of Indonesian fishery products with residues and will deter producers in Indonesia misuse of substances.\n(4) It is necessary to set uniform testing requirements for the importation of the consignments of farmed fishery products from Indonesia at a defined minimum level because the products may be imported via several Member States.\n(5) Member States are requested to report to the Commission the detection of the presence of pharmacologically active substances not authorised for use in food producing animals by Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) or residues of pharmacologically active substances of a levels that exceeds the maximum residue limits established according to Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 via Rapid Alert System set up by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and regularly submit reports of all tests to provide the Commission with the necessary information to consider whether it is necessary to maintain or modify this interim measure in the light of the information provided.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["This Decision shall apply to the importation of consignments of farmed fishery products from Indonesia intended for human consumption.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall, by using appropriate sampling plans, ensure that samples are taken from at least 20\u00a0% of the consignments referred to in Article 1 presented for import at Border Inspection Posts on their territory.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The samples taken pursuant to paragraph 1 shall undergo analytical tests for the detection of residues of pharmacologically active substances defined in Article 2(a) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009, and in particular of chloramphenicol, metabolites of nitrofurans and tetracyclines (at least tetracycline, oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline).", "The consignments from which samples have been taken pursuant to Article 2(1) shall be kept under official detention by the competent authority of the Member State concerned, until analytical tests have been completed.
