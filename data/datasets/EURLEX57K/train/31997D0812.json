No decision need be taken, therefore, as to the admissibility or the merits of those requests. However, the suspension of payment has to be lifted to allow collection of the anti-dumping duties due. The parties concerned are listed in Annex I;\n(6) Other parties which had requested an exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty did not cooperate with the Commission within the period specified. Those parties are mentioned in Annex II. In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97, the Commission informed those parties that it intended to reject their request for exemption from the extended duty, on the grounds that they had failed to provide the information requested for the determination of the admissibility of their request within the period specified. The parties were given an opportunity to comment;\n(7) It is no longer justified for the parties listed in Annex I and Annex II to benefit from a suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty. The suspension should be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty should be collected,", "main_body": ["The requests for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty made in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 by the parties listed in Annex II to this Decision are hereby rejected as inadmissible.", "The suspension of payment of the extended anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 is hereby lifted for the parties listed in Annexes I and II to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States and to the parties listed in Annexes I and II."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 November 1997.\nFor the Commission\nLeon BRITTAN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ L 56, 6. 3. 1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 317, 6. 12. 1996, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 16, 18. 1. 1997, p. 55.\n(4) OJ L 17, 21. 1. 1997, p. 17.\n(5) OJ C 45, 13. 2. 1997, p. 3 and OJ C 112, 10. 4. 1997, p. 9.\nANNEX I\n>TABLE>\nANNEX II\n>TABLE>"}
