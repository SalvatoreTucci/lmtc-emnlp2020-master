Following inclusion of the substances in Annex I, those Member States authorised a number of plant protection products containing them in accordance with Article 4 of the Directive, and established provisional maximum residue levels as required by Article 4(1)(f). As required by the Directive, those levels, and the information on which they were based, have been notified to the Commission. This information together with data available from other sources has been reviewed and is sufficient to fix certain maximum residue levels (MRLS). Where no Community maximum residue level or provisional MRL exists, Member States must establish a national provisional maximum residue level in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of the Directive before the authorisation may be granted. In view of Article 5 of Directive 86/363/EEC, this also applies for provisional MRLs for animal products where commodities containing residues of an active substance may be expected to be used as animal feeds.\n(4) At their inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the technical and scientific evaluations of azimsulfuron, and prohexadione calcium were finalised on 2 July 1999, and 16 June 2000, respectively in the Commission review reports for azimsulfuron and prohexadione calcium. In these review reports the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for azimsulfuron was set at 0,1 mg/kg bw/day, and for prohexadione calcium at 0,2 mg/kg bw/day. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with azimsulfuron, and prohexadione calcium has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(9) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(10) on this methodology. It has been calculated that the maximum residue levels provided for in this Directive do not result in these ADIs being exceeded.\n(5) Acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an acute reference dose were not noted during the evaluations and discussions that preceded the inclusion of azimsulfuron, and prohexadione calcium in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(6) To ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set provisional maximum residue levels at the lower limit of analytical determination for all those products covered by Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC. The setting at Community level of such provisional maximum residue levels does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional maximum residue levels for azimsulfuron and prohexadione calcium in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. Four years is considered a sufficient period of time during which to establish most further uses of azimsulfuron and prohexadione calcium. After that period these provisional maximum residue levels should become definitive.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive were communicated to the World Trade Organisation and the comments received were taken into consideration. The possibility of fixing import tolerance maximum residue levels for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of the submission of acceptable data.\n(8) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["In part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC the following rows are added:\n>TABLE>", "In part B of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC the following row is added:\n>TABLE>", "In Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC the columns headed \"Azimsulfuron\", and \"Prohexadione (prohexadione and its salts expressed as prohexadione)\" set out in the Annex to this Directive are added.", "Member States shall adopt and publish the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2001 at the latest.
