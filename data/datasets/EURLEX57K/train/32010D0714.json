In line with a possibility to derogate from that Decision, the entry of such tubers into the Union was permitted from \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 and subject to specific conditions in previous years, including the 2009/2010 import season.\n(2) During the 2009/2010 import season, only one interception of Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith was recorded in the Union.\n(3) As requested by Egypt, and in the light of the information provided by it, the Commission has established that the risk of spreading Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith with the entry into the Union of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L. from \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 of Egypt has been sufficiently mitigated, provided that the specific conditions indicated in Decision 2004/4/EC are satisfied.\n(4) The entry into the Union of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L., originating in \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 of Egypt, should therefore be permitted for the 2010/2011 import season.\n(5) Decision 2004/4/EC established that it had to be reviewed by 30 September 2010. In light of the above findings, the deadline for the review should be extended.\n(6) Decision 2004/4/EC should be therefore amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/4/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2(1), \u20182009/2010\u2019 is replaced by \u20182010/2011\u2019;\n2. in Article 4, \u201831 August 2010\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 August 2011\u2019;\n3. in Article 7, \u201830 September 2010\u2019 is replaced by \u201830 September 2011\u2019;\n4. the Annex is amended as follows:\n(a) in point 1(b)(iii), \u20182009/2010\u2019 is replaced by \u20182010/2011\u2019;\n(b) in the second indent of point 1(b)(iii), \u20181 January 2010\u2019 is replaced by \u20181 January 2011\u2019;\n(c) in point 1(b)(xii), \u20181 January 2010\u2019 is replaced by \u20181 January 2011\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 November 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 2, 6.1.2004, p. 50."}
