The yield to be used shall be the average yield of non-deseeded straw on the areas covered by aid applications or, where the applicants are growers within the meaning of Article 3a(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 619/71, the yield on the areas of each owner or farmer with whom a contract for flax growing has been concluded.\n2. The average yield as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equal to the tonnage of non-deseeded straw ready for processing weighed on entry at the processing plant, divided by the area in hectares.\nHowever,\n- where the straw is harvested separately from the seed, the weight of the seed shall be added to the weight of the straw entering the processing plant, and\n- where the straw is harvested using a machine that separates the fibre from the woody parts, the weight of the straw shall be replaced by the total weight of the various products resulting from that separation. Where it is not possible to weigh the woody parts of the stalk, the Member State shall, in the light of the results corresponding to good cultivation methods, establish the weight concerned by means of a coefficient fixed on the basis of on-the-spot checks and the technical specifications of the machine in question.\n3. Compliance with the minimum yield shall be established on the basis of the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 available before a date set by the Member State which is before 30 June in the marketing year in question. Where that information reveals that the minimum yield has not been complied with, the Member State shall inform the interested party and, at the latter's request, shall take account, after verification on the spot, of the estimated weight of the quantities relative to the marketing year in question which he is holding in store.", "Where the minimum yields laid down in Article 1 are not achieved, the aid payable for the areas in question shall be reduced by 65 %.", "Regulation (EC) No 2183/97 shall be repealed with effect from 1 August 1999.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the 1999/2000 marketing year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 March 1999.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 146, 4. 7. 1970, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 349, 31. 12. 1994, p. 105.\n(3) OJ L 72, 26. 3. 1971, p. 2.\n(4) OJ L 190, 4. 7. 1998, p. 7.\n(5) OJ L 121, 29. 4. 1989, p. 4.\n(6) OJ L 349, 22. 12. 1998, p. 50.\n(7) OJ L 299, 4. 11. 1997, p. 4."}
