whereas, the quota duty is equal to 40 % of the Common Customs Tariff duty in respect of the products concerned; whereas this Community tariff quota should be opened for 1985;\nWhereas it is in particular necessary to ensure to all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the principles mentioned above, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market of the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States calculated by reference to the statistics of imports from Spain over a representative period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;\nWhereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, the corresponding imports by each of the Member States represent the following percentages of the imports into the Community from Spain of the products concerned:\n1.2.3.4 //   //   //   //   // Member State  // 1981  // 1982  // 1983  //   //   //   //   // Benelux  // 4,8  // 1,7  // 0,7  // Denmark  // 0,3  // 0,2  // 0,1  // Germany  // 3,6  // 5,1  // 4,1  // Greece  // -  // 0,3  // 1,1  // France  // 74,2  // 60,1  // 58,2  // Ireland  // 12,0  // 21,2  // 27,8  // Italy  // 3,9  // 8,0  // 4,2  // United Kingdom  // 1,2  // 3,4  // 3,8  //   //   //   //\nWhereas, in view of these factors, and of market forecasts for the products in question and in particular of the estimates submitted by certain Member States, initial quota shares may be fixed approximately at the following percentages:\nBenelux 2,1\nDenmark 0,3\nGermany 4,4\nGreece 0,6\nFrance 63,6\nIreland 22,1\nItaly 3,8\nUnited Kingdom 3,1\nWhereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among the Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover at a later date the requirements of those Member States having used up their initial quota shares; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota should under present circumstances be fixed at 85 % of the quota;\nWhereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must be in a position to\nmonitor the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States thereof;\nWhereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a substantial quantity of an initial share remains unused in a Member State, it is essential that that Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve, to prevent a part of any Community quota from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["From 1 January until 31 December 1985, the Common Customs Tariff duties in respect of the products originating in Spain and listed below shall be partially suspended at the levels indicated for each of them within the limits of a global Community tariff quota of 2 013 tonnes:\n1.2.3 //   //   //   // CCT heading No  // Description  // Rate of duty (%)  //   //   //   // 55.09  // Other woven fabrics of cotton:  //   //   // A.
