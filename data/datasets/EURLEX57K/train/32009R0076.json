In the absence of such request, paragraph 3 of the same Article provides that the additional duty is to be established on the basis of the representative price referred to in Article 2(2) of the said Regulation.\n(2) The Court of Justice of the European Communities in its judgment given on 13\u00a0December 2001 in Case C-317/99 Kloosterboer Rotterdam BV v Minister van Landbouw, Natuurbeheer en Visserij\n\u00a0(3) stated that paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article\u00a03 of Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01484/95 of 28\u00a0June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of additional import duties and fixing additional import duties in the poultrymeat and egg sectors and for egg albumin, and repealing Regulation No\u00a0163/67/EEC\u00a0(4), are invalid, inasmuch as they provide that the additional duty referred to therein is, as a general rule, established on the basis of the representative price laid down in Article\u00a02(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01484/95 and that the duty is established on the basis of the cif import price of the shipment concerned only if the importer so requests. Those paragraphs were identical to Article 4(1) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 504/2007. Article 28(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products\u00a0(5) corresponds to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat\u00a0(6). Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 504/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(3) In order to comply with the Court ruling, Regulation (EC) No 504/2007 should be amended accordingly.\n(4) As from 1 January 2008, some CN codes of Chapter 4 have been amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1214/2007 of 20 September 2007 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\u00a0(7).
