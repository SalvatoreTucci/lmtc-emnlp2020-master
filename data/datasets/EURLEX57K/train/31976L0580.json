(4)OJ No L 104, 24.4.1975, p. 35.\nWhereas Article 4 of the aforesaid Protocol is undergoing revision ; whereas, pursuant to the Decision of 18 March 1975 of the Board of Governors of the EIB, the Bank uses the European unit of account defined by Council Decision 75/250/EEC;\nWhereas more recently, on 18 December 1975, the Commission, by Decision No 3289/75/ECSC (1), adopted, with the unanimous assent of the Council, this European unit of account in applying the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community;\nWhereas the value of the European unit of account in each of the Member States' currencies is fixed daily and whereas a reference day must also be fixed for its use when applying this Directive;\nWhereas, however, in certain Member States the introduction of the European unit of account would lead to a reduction in terms of national currency of the amounts expressed in units of account in the Directive ; whereas such a reduction would lead to a corresponding reduction in the protection now given to insured parties by the minimum guarantee fund ; whereas the said amounts should be reviewed every two years ; whereas, as a result of this review, the amounts in question are likely to be amended ; whereas in certain Member States the reduction in the amounts expressed in national currency could, under these conditions, be swiftly followed by a further adjustment in those States ; whereas the implementation of these successive measures would raise difficulties for undertakings and supervisory authorities ; whereas, therefore, these amounts should be kept at the level which they would have reached on the basis of the conversion rate applicable before the introduction of the European unit of account, if this level is higher than that of the European unit of account, until the amounts fixed in Directive 73/239/EEC are reviewed;\nWhereas changes in the economic and monetary situation of the Community justify the examination at regular intervals of the latter amounts,", "main_body": ["1.
