As far as Poland and Russia are concerned, the results of this investigation are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 593/97 (4);\n(2) The investigation revealed that imports of unwrought, unalloyed zinc originating in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan are below the negligibility threshold referred to in Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, since imports from those countries represent a market share of below 1 % respectively and below 3 % collectively of the Community consumption. Consequently, the injury suffered by the Community industry as a result of imports from Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan is to be regarded as negligible and the proceeding should be terminated with respect to imports of unwrought, unalloyed zinc originating in those countries,", "main_body": ["The proceeding concerning imports of unwrought, unalloyed zinc originating in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 March 1997.\nFor the Commission\nLeon BRITTAN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 56, 6. 3. 1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 317, 6. 12. 1996, p. 1.\n(3) OJ No C 143, 9. 6. 1995, p. 12.\n(4) See page 6 of this Official Journal."}
