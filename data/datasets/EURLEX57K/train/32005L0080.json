Substances classified as CMR of category 3 under Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC should also be included in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC, except if they have been evaluated by the SCCP and found acceptable for use in cosmetic products.\n(4) Substances classified as CMR of category 1 and 2 listed in Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC should be deleted, since these substances are now listed in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC and therefore must not form part of the composition of cosmetic products.\n(5) Commission Directive 2004/93/EC\u00a0(5) provided for the insertion in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC of certain substances which were already listed there. That Annex should therefore be amended for the sake of clarity.\n(6) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the text set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that from 22 August 2006 cosmetic products which fail to comply with this Directive are not placed on the market by Community manufacturers or by importers established within the Community.\nMember States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that those products are not sold or disposed of to the final consumer after 22 November 2006.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 22 May 2006 at the latest.
