However, the intention was never to restrict the placing on the market or putting into service of equipment solely based on technical feasibility.\n(3) It is therefore necessary to provide that certain types of equipment listed in Article\u00a012 of Directive 2000/14/EC, which would not be able to meet the stage II limits by 3\u00a0January\u00a02006 solely for technical reasons, can still be placed on the market and/or put into service as from that date.\n(4) The experience of the first five years of application of Directive 2000/14/EC has demonstrated that more time is needed to fulfil the provisions under Articles\u00a016 and\u00a020 thereof and highlighted the need to review that Directive with a view to\u00a0its possible amendment, in particular with respect to the stage II limits referred to therein. It is therefore necessary to extend by two years the deadline for submission of the report to the European\u00a0Parliament and to the Council on the Commission\u2019s experience in implementing and administering Directive\u00a02000/14/EC as referred to\u00a0in Article\u00a020(1) of that Directive.\n(5) Article\u00a020(3) of Directive 2000/14/EC provides for the submission, by the Commission, of a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on whether, and to what extent, technical progress allows a reduction of limit values for lawnmowers and lawn trimmers/lawn-edge trimmers. In view of the fact that the obligations contained in Article\u00a020(1) of that Directive are more prescriptive than those in Article\u00a020(3), and\u00a0in order to avoid duplication of effort, it is appropriate to\u00a0include these types of equipment in the general report provided for in Article\u00a020(1) of that Directive. Consequently, the separate reporting obligation in Article\u00a020(3) of that Directive should be deleted.\n(6) Since the objective of this Directive, namely, to ensure the ongoing functioning of the internal market by requiring equipment used outdoors to\u00a0comply with harmonised environmental noise provisions, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and\u00a0can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective, in that its scope is confined to those types of equipment for which compliance with the stage\u00a0II limits is presently impossible for technical reasons.\n(7) In accordance with point\u00a034 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law\u00a0making\u00a0(4), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and\u00a0in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(8) Directive\u00a02000/14/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Directive 2000/14/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
