It is therefore necessary to use a standard form for refusal of entry, which includes a categorisation of the possible reasons for refusal, and to indicate in the passport of the alien concerned the reason(s) for refusal. The Common Manual\u00a0(2) should therefore be amended accordingly. The possibilities to appeal against the decision for refusal of entry are provided for in national law.\n(2) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title\u00a0IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article\u00a05 of the said Protocol, decide, within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision, whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(3) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the\u00a0European\u00a0Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(3), which fall within the area referred to in Article\u00a01, point\u00a0A, of Council\u00a0Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement\u00a0(4).\n(4) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision\u00a02000/365/EC of 29\u00a0May\u00a02000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\u00a0Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(5); the United\u00a0Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(5) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision\u00a02002/192/EC of 28\u00a0February\u00a02002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(6); Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(6) This Decision constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of the Act of Accession,", "main_body": ["Part\u00a0II of the Common\u00a0Manual is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following sentence shall be added at the end of Section\u00a01.4.1:\n2.
