The communication of that information in groups of products should therefore no longer be required.\n(3) Article 17(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amounts of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1052/2002(6), has expanded the range of goods and lowered the threshold for declaring whether these goods contain a high percentage of certain milk products. Regulation (EC) No 3223/93 should be adapted to reflect this change.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 3223/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on Horizontal Questions relating to trade in Processed Agricultural Products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 3223/93 is amended as follows:\n1.
