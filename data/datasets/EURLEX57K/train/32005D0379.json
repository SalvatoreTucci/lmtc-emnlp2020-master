The Directive also provides that the particulars to be shown in pedigree certificates should be harmonised.\n(2) The model pedigree certificates and the particulars to be provided either in such models or in equivalent documentation are currently laid down for pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species in Commission Decision 86/404/EEC\u00a0(2), for semen and embryos in Commission Decision 88/124/EEC\u00a0(3) and for ova in Commission Decision 96/80/EC\u00a0(4). In the interests of clarity and rationality of Community legislation, Decisions 86/404/EEC, 88/124/EEC and 96/80/EC should be repealed and replaced by a single Decision.\n(3) Provisions on the identification of bovine animals are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97\u00a0(5).\n(4) Special provisions on the official testing of pure-bred bulls are laid down in Council Directive 87/328/EEC of 18 June 1987 on the acceptance for breeding purposes of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species\u00a0(6).\n(5) Pedigree certificates should ensure for customers of an animal or its germinal products the minimum information corresponding to the particulars required by Decisions 86/404/EEC, 88/124/EEC and 96/80/EC. Based on experience with the evolution of information technologies, and taking into account the fact that certain results of genetic evaluation are publicly available, it appears that the recommendation of a harmonised model of certificate is no longer necessary, and that certain particulars may in some instances be sufficiently provided by a reference to their public source.\n(6) Pedigree certificates or statements certifying equivalent documentation are issued by bodies recognised in accordance with Commission Decision 84/247/EEC of 27 April 1984 laying down the criteria for the recognition of breeders\u2019 organisations and associations which maintain or establish herd-books for pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species\u00a0(7). However, it appears appropriate that pedigree certificates for semen may also be issued by collection or storage centres approved in accordance with Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species\u00a0(8) and that pedigree certificates for embryos may also be issued by collection teams approved in accordance with Council Directive 89/556/EEC of 25 September 1989 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species\u00a0(9).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Zootechnics,", "main_body": ["This Decision lays down the particulars to be contained either in pedigree certificates or in documents accompanying the pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species, their semen, ova and embryos in intra-Community trade.
