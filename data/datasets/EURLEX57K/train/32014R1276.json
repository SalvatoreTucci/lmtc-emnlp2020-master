Since then, he has continued trying to run destabilization operations in order to maintain tensions in the capital of CAR. Bozize reportedly created the anti-Balaka militia group before he fled the CAR on March 24, 2013. In a communique, Bozize called on his militia to pursue the atrocities against the current regime and the Islamists. Bozize reportedly provided financial and material support to militiamen who are working to destabilize the ongoing transition and to bring Bozize back to power. The bulk of the anti-Balaka are from the Central African Armed Forces who dispersed into the countryside after the coup d'\u00e9tat and were subsequently reorganized by Bozize. Bozize and his supporters control more than half the anti-Balaka units.\nForces loyal to Bozize were armed with assault rifles, mortars and rocket-launchers and they have become increasingly involved in reprisal attacks against CAR's Muslim population. The situation in CAR deteriorated rapidly after the December 5, 2013 attack in Bangui by anti-Balaka forces that left over 700 people dead.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nourredine ADAM (alias: a) Nureldine Adam; b) Nourreldine Adam; c) Nourreddine Adam; d) Mahamat Nouradine Adam)\nDesignation: a) General; b) Minister for Security; c) Director General of the \u201cExtraordinary Committee for the Defence of Democratic Achievements\u201d.\nDate of birth: a) 1970 b) 1969 c) 1971 d) 1 January 1970.\nPlace of birth: Ndele, Central African Republic.\nNationality: Central African Republic. Passport no.: D00001184\nAddress: Birao, Central African Republic.\nDate of UN designation: 9 May 2014\nInformation from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions\u00a0Committee:\nNourredine was listed on 9 May 2014 pursuant to paragraph 36 of resolution 2134 (2014) as \u201cengaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of CAR.\u201d\nAdditional information\nNoureddine is one of the original leaders of the Seleka. He has been identified as both a General and the President of one of the armed rebel groups of the Seleka, the Central PJCC, a group formally known as the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace and whose acronym is also acknowledged as CPJP. As former head of the \u201cFundamental\u201d splinter group of the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP/F), he was the military coordinator of the ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka during offensives in the former rebellion in the Central African Republic between early December 2012 and March 2013. Without Noureddine's assistance and close relationship with Chadian Special Forces, the Seleka would likely have been unable to wrest power from former CAR President Francois Bozize.\nSince the appointment as interim president of Catherine Samba-Panza on 20 January 2014, he was one of the main architects of the ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka's tactical withdrawal in Sibut with the aim of implementing his plan to create a Muslim stronghold in the north of the country. He had clearly urged his forces to resist the injunctions of the transitional government and of the military leaders of the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA). Noureddine actively directs ex-Seleka, the former Seleka forces that were reportedly dissolved by Djotodia in September 2013, and directs operations against Christian neighborhoods and continues to provide significant support and direction to the ex-Seleka operating in CAR.\nNourredine was also listed on 9 May 2014 pursuant to paragraph 37(b) of resolution 2134 (2014) as \u201cinvolved in planning, directing, or committing acts that violate international human rights law or international humanitarian law, as applicable.\u201d\nAdditional information\nAfter the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka took control of Bangui on 24 March 2013, Nourredine Adam was appointed Minister for Security, then Director General of the \u201cExtraordinary Committee for the Defence of Democratic Achievements\u201d (Comit\u00e9 extraordinaire de d\u00e9fense des acquis d\u00e9mocratiques- CEDAD, a now-defunct CAR intelligence service). Nourredine Adam used the CEDAD as his personal political police, carrying out many arbitrary arrests, acts of torture and summary executions. In addition, Noureddine was one of the key figures behind the bloody operation in Boy Rabe. In August 2013, Seleka forces stormed Boy Rabe, a CAR neighborhood regarded as a bastion of Francois Bozize supporters and his ethnic group. Under the pretext of looking for arms caches, Seleka troops reportedly killed scores of civilians and went on a rampage of looting. When these raids spread to other quarters, thousands of residents invaded the international airport, which was perceived as a safe place because of the presence of French troops, and occupied its runway.\nNourredine was also listed on 9 May 2014 pursuant to paragraph 37(d) of resolution 2134 (2014) as \u201cproviding support for armed groups or criminal networks through illegal exploitation of natural\u00a0resources\u201d.\nAdditional information\nIn early 2013, Nourredine Adam played an important role in the ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka's financing networks. He travelled to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to collect funds for the former rebellion. He also operated as a facilitator for a Chadian diamond-trafficking ring operating between the Central African Republic and Chad.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Levy YAKETE (alias: a) Levi Yakite; b) Levy Yak\u00e9t\u00e9; c) Levi Yak\u00e9t\u00e9)\nDate of birth: a) 14 August 1964 b) 1965.\nPlace of Birth: Bangui, Central African Republic.\nNationality: Central African Republic.\nAddress: Nantes, France.\nOther information: Father's name is Pierre Yak\u00e9t\u00e9 and Mother's name is Jos\u00e9phine Yamazon.\nDate of UN designation: 9 May 2014\nInformation from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:\nYakete was listed on 9 May 2014 pursuant to paragraph 36 of resolution 2134 (2014) as \u201cengaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of CAR.\u201d\nAdditional information\nOn December 17, 2013, Yakite became the political coordinator of the newly formed People's Resistance Movement for Reforming of the Central African Republic anti-Balaka rebel group. He has been directly involved in decisions of a rebel group that has been involved in acts that have undermined peace, stability and security in the CAR, in particular on and since 5 December 2013. In addition, this group has been explicitly singled out by resolutions 2127, 2134 and 2149 for such acts. Yakite has been accused of ordering the arrest of people connected to the Seleka, calling for attacks on people who do not support President Bozize, and recruiting young militiamen to attack those hostile to the regime with machetes. Having remained in the entourage of Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 after March 2013, he joined the Front for the Return to Constitutional Order in CAR (Front pour le Retour \u00e0 l'Ordre Constitutionnel en CentrAfrique \u2014 FROCCA), which aimed to return the deposed president to power by whatever means necessary.\nIn late summer 2013, he travelled to Cameroon and Benin, where he attempted to recruit people to fight against the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka. In September 2013, he tried to regain control over operations led by pro-Boziz\u00e9 fighters in towns and villages near to Bossangoa. Yak\u00e9t\u00e9 is also suspected of promoting the distribution of machetes to young unemployed Christians to facilitate their attacks on Muslims.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entities\u2019"}
