Thermometers incorporated in the instrument used to determine alcoholic strength\nIf the instrument used to determine alcoholic strength belongs to Class II or III, a thermometer of the mercury-expansion type with glass casing may be incorporated therein.  9.1.1. The thermometer shall be graduated to 0 71 or 0 72 or 0 75 \u00b0C and it need not have any scale mark at 0 \u00b0C.\n9.1.2. The minimum scale spacing shall be:\n0 78 mm in the case of thermometers graduated to 0 71 and 0 72 \u00b0C;\n1 70 mm in the case of thermometers graduated to 0 75 \u00b0C.\n9.1.3. The thickness of the lines shall not be more than one fifth of the scale spacing.\n9.1.4. The maximum permissible error, positive or negative, shall be:\n0 710 \u00b0C if the thermometer is graduated to 0 71 \u00b0C;\n0 720 \u00b0C if the thermometer is graduated to 0 72 or 0 75 \u00b0C.\n9.1.5. During EEC initial verification, the error of the incorporated thermometer shall be determined at a minimum of three points in the scale range.\n9.2. Thermometers not incorporated in an instrument used to determine alcoholic strength  9.2.1. If the instrument used to determine alcoholic strength belongs to Class I, the thermometer employed in conjunction with it shall be:  - either of the metallic resistance type, enabling the temperature of the mixture of water and alcohol to be determined with a maximum permissible error of \u00b1 0 710 \u00b0C,\n- or of the mercury-expansion type with a glass casing graduated to 0 71 or 0 75 \u00b0C.\nMercury thermometers shall have a scale mark at 0 \u00b0C, the minimum scale spacing shall be 0 78 mm and the thickness of the lines shall not be more than one fifth of the scale spacing.\nThe maximum permissible error, positive or negative, shall be one scale interval.\n9.2.2. If the instrument used to determine alcoholic strength belongs to Class II or III, the thermometer employed in conjunction with it shall be of the mercury-expansion type with glass casing.  9.2.2.1. The thermometer shall be graduated to 0 71 or 0 72 or 0 75 \u00b0C. It shall have a scale mark at 0 \u00b0C.\n9.2.2.2. The minimum scale spacing shall be:\n0 78 mm in the case of thermometers graduated to 0 71 or 0 72 \u00b0C;\n1 70 mm in the case of thermometers graduated to 0 75 \u00b0C.\n9.2.2.3. The thickness of the lines shall not be more than one fifth of the scale spacing.\n9.2.2.4. The maximum permissible error shall be:\n\u00b1 0 710 \u00b0C if the thermometer is graduated to 0 71 \u00b0C;\n\u00b1 0 720 \u00b0C if the thermometer is graduated to 0 72 or 0 75 \u00b0C."}
