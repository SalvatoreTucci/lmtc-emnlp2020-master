The respective aid amounts will be approximately 150 EUR/ha for autumn wheat, 120 EUR/ha for rapeseed and 130 EUR/ha for barley and other autumn crops.\n(8) The aid will be granted on farmer\u2019s application only, for the specific purpose of restarting the production cycle (purchase of seeds, fuel, fertilisers and pesticides). The Romanian Payment Agency will monitor and control the aid, inter alia, by carrying out on-the-spot checks.\n(9) In order to be effective, the State aid must be granted and accessed by farmers as soon as possible.\n(10) The Commission has not at this stage given an opinion on the nature and compatibility of the aid.\n(11) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the emergency situation which has risen, to be compatible with the common market on the terms specified in the Decision,", "main_body": ["Exceptional additional aid by the Romanian authorities to the agricultural sector, amounting to a maximum of EUR 400 million, shall be considered to be compatible with the common market.", "This Decision is addressed to Romania."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 22 October 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
