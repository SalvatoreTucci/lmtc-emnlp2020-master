This indicative quantity should be fixed taking into consideration the quantities covered by storage contracts in past years.\n(6) Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 stipulates that the entry into storage must take place between 15 March and 15 August. The current situation on the butter market justifies bringing the entry date for butter and cream storage operations in 2005 forward to 1 March. Consequently a derogation from that Article should be introduced.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The aid referred to in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 shall be calculated per tonne of butter or butter equivalent for contracts concluded in 2005 on the basis of the following elements:\n(a) for all contracts:\n\u2014 EUR\u00a017,92 for fixed storage costs,\n\u2014 EUR\u00a00,33 for the costs of cold storage for each day of contractual storage,\n\u2014 an amount per day of contractual storage, calculated on the basis of 90\u00a0% of the intervention price for butter in force on the day the contractual storage begins and on the basis of an annual interest rate of 2,25\u00a0%;\n(b) EUR\u00a0102,60 for contracts which have been concluded on the basis of applications received by the intervention agency before 1 July 2005.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The intervention agency shall register the date of receipt of the applications to conclude a contract as referred to in Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 as well as the corresponding quantities and dates of manufacture and the place at which the butter is stored.\nThe Member States shall inform the Commission no later than 12 noon (Brussels time) of each Tuesday of the quantities covered during the preceding week by such applications.
