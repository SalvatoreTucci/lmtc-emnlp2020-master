Therefore it is necessary to modify the budget distribution among the different financing mechanisms indicated in point 2 of Annex I to Decision 2011/C 69/01 to allow for financing of a larger number of project grants.\n(3) The variations in the budget initially allocated to the specific actions exceed the 20\u00a0% indicated in Article 5 of Decision 2011/C 69/01 and therefore constitute a substantial change of the financing decision adopted necessitating its amendment. The financial flexibility of 20\u00a0% should apply to the different financing mechanisms.\n(4) This Decision is also a financing decision for the Presidency conference to be held in the first half of 2012 under the Danish Presidency mentioned in Annex I point 2.4.1 of Decision 2011/C 69/01.\n(5) Decision 2011/C 69/01 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 10 of the Programme Decision,", "main_body": ["Decision 2011/C 69/01 is amended as follows:\n1.
