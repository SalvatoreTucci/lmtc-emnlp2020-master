Projections made in 2007 showed a primary energy consumption in 2020 of 1\u00a0842 Mtoe for the 27 Member States. The same projections show a primary energy consumption in 2020 of 1\u00a0853 Mtoe for the 28 Member States including Croatia. A 20\u00a0% reduction results in 1\u00a0483 Mtoe in 2020, i.e. a reduction of 370 Mtoe as compared to projections. This technical adaptation is necessary to allow Directive 2012/27/EU to be applicable in Croatia.\n(5) Directive 2012/27/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Directive 2012/27/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "The amendments set out in the Annex to this Directive shall be without prejudice to the time limit provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 28(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU.", "This Directive shall enter into force subject to and as from the date of the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Croatia.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 May 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nS.
