For the Council\nThe President\nLuis VALENTE DE OLIVEIRA\n(1) OJ No C 174, 16. 7. 1990, p. 35. (2) OJ No C 326, 16. 12. 1991, p. 128 and Decision of 11 March 1992 (not yet published in the Official Journal). (3) OJ No C 41, 18. 2. 1991, p. 4. (4) OJ No L 117, 8. 5. 1990, p. 28.\nANNEX I\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES AND CONTENT\nThis specific programme fully reflects the approach embodied in the third Framework Programme in terms of the scientific and technical goals and the underlying aims which it pursues.\nParagraph 2C of Annex II of the Framework Programme forms an integral part of the present specific programme.\nThe aim is to achieve better harmonization of measuring, analytical and testing methods and to assist in the development of new methods for measurements and testing in Europe, as well as to seek to provide generic tools for securing accurate and valid  measurements. To attain this objective, advances must be made in measurements, testing techniques and chemical analyses where they are not sufficiently accurate and, therefore, laboratories cannot mutually agree on their results and where the  measurement methods are insufficient to satisfy the new challenges in industry, in the monitoring of the environment, food quality and health and in the facilitation of trade within the Single Market.\nThe aim is also to develop new methods of physical measurement and chemical and biological analysis, and to establish a good understanding of the generic limitation and sources of error inherent in current methods with a view to improving them in the  most efficient way.\nSupport will also be provided for collaborative research and development into new or improved measurement standards, and into innovative means of calibration, which contribute to meeting the overall aim of the programme and which are more effectively or  economically undertaken at Community level.\nThe research activities will be closely connected to the requirements of the internal market (as specified in the White Paper on the Completion of the Internal Market) and to the implementation of specific Community policies. Close coordination with the  relevant research programmes, European metrology and organizations concerned with standardization (such as, for example, CEN/CENELEC) will be also assured.\nThe following presents an analytical description of the content of the programme, based on, and taking account of, the above elements.\nAREA 1: SUPPORT TO REGULATIONS AND DIRECTIVES\nThe aim is to improve methods of obtaining reliable and internationally accepted results for the application of Directives, in particular on food products, industrial products, environment and health.\nThe work will consist in developing, improving or harmonizing the test methods required for the implementation of existing Directives and the preparation of new Regulations and Directives.\nAccordingly, work will concentrate on, in particular:\n- analysis of agricultural products, including animal feedingstuffs,\n- analysis of prepared foodstuffs,\n- measurement of contaminants in the air, in water and in soil (including bacterial contamination),\n- measurement of noise and of harmful substances in the workplace,\n- biomedical analysis,\n- testing of industrial products.\nFor existing Regulations and Directives, collaboration between the different laboratories will be encouraged, so as to help overcome difficulties in the application and harmonization of methodologies.\nAREA 2: SECTORAL TESTING PROBLEMS\nThe aim will be to contribute to the implementation of 'the Global Approach to Conformity Assessment' of industrial products (Council Resolution of 21 December 1989 (1)) through support to European Standardization, laboratory accreditation and mutual  recognition.\nThe work will consist in developing collaborative projects to improve measuring and testing techniques for industrial products, in order to achieve agreed results at Community level between laboratories within a particular industrial sector. This will  include:\n- collaborative projects for improving or developing new testing methods which are likely to become European standards (CEN, CENELEC) where advances in the corresponding field are insufficient for the introduction of a directive on a given product;\n- collaborative projects for the improvement of standardized measuring and testing methods where the application thereof presents difficulties;\n- support for the organization of comparative studies amongst laboratories where this is necessary to facilitate mutual recognition agreements amongst test laboratories.\nAREA 3: COMMON MEANS OF CALIBRATION FOR THE COMMUNITY\nThe objective is to support projects to develop the calibration means required by testing laboratories in the Community, to ensure that measurements and tests are done on a common basis and can be compared also with measurements done outside the  Community.\nWith regard to physical measurements, transfer standards will be developed to enable smaller national metrology laboratories to establish relations and traceability of measurements with larger organizations. This will be done with particular attention  to the needs of the newer Member States.\nWith regard to chemical analyses, work will include support for collaborative projects towards establishing an internationally recognized framework for chemical measurements including primary chemical standards and secondary standards. More  specifically, reference materials will be developed for the most important parameters of the measurements made in the food sector, agriculture, the environment and biomedical analysis, as described in Area 1.\nAREA 4: DEVELOPMENT OF NEW METHODS OF MEASUREMENTS\nThe aim is to develop new methods of measurements and analysis as required by Community policies. Basic research will be undertaken to achieve this aim.\nSuch development will concentrate on:\n- R &  D on measurement principles which could lead to new types of instrumentation;\n- new measurement methods in the specialist areas mentioned above (Area 1), in particular the determination of the chemical form of polluting elements (speciation), food and biomedical analyses;\n- R &  D into new measurement methods required to relate frequently made measurements to the framework arising from Area 3.\nThe work will be carried out in coordination with other specific R &  D programmes within the Framework Programme.\n(1) OJ No C 10, 16. 1. 1990, p. 1.\nANNEX II\nINDICATIVE BREAKDOWN OF FUNDS DEEMED NECESSARY\n(in million ecus)\nArea  Allocation     1. Support to Regulations and Directives  12  2. Sectorial testing problems  11,52  3. Support to means of calibration  12  4. Development of new methods of measurements  12    47,52 (1) (2)\n(1) Including  expenditure on staff amounting to ECU 6 million and administration expenditure totalling ECU 3 million.\n(2) An amount deemed necessary of ECU 0,48 million, not included in the ECU 47,52 million, will be earmarked as the contribution from the specific programme in the field of measurements and testing to the centralized scheme for the dissemination and  exploitation of results.\nAn amount equivalent to at least 10 % of the total shall be used for projects encouraging fundamental research, which shall be clearly identified.\nAn amount equivalent to at least 2 % of the total shall be devoted to training of researchers in the fields covered by this specific programme.\nAn additional amount of ECU 92 million will be allocated to JRC research in the field of measurements and testing, including an amount of ECU 0,92 million representing the JRC contribution to the centralized scheme for dissemination and exploitation of  results under this specific programme.\nThe breakdown between different areas does not exclude the possibility that projects could cover several areas.\nANNEX III\nRULES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMME\n1. The Commission will implement the programme on the basis of the scientific and technical content described in Annex I.\n2. The rules for implementing the programme, referred to in Article 3, comprise research and technological development projects, concerted actions and accompanying measures. Selection of projects must take account of the criteria listed in Annex III to  Decision 90/221/Euratom, EEC and of the objectives set out in Annex I to this programme.\n- Research projects\nThe projects will be the subject of shared-cost research and technological development contracts and Community financial participation which will not normally be more than 50 %. Universities and other research centres participating in shared-cost  projects will have the option of requesting, for each project, either 50 % funding of total expenditure or 100 % funding of the additional marginal costs.\nShared-cost research projects must, as a general rule, be carried out by participants established within the Community. Projects in which, for example, universities, research organizations and industrial firms, including small and medium-sized  enterprises, may take part must provide, as a general rule, for the participation of at least two partners, independent of each other and established in different Member States. Contracts relating to shared-cost research projects must as a general rule  be concluded following a selection procedure based on calls for proposals published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n- Concerted actions\nConcerted actions consist of action by the Community to coordinate the individual research activities carried out in the Member States. They may benefit from funding of up to 100 % of coordinating expenditure.\n- Accompanying measures\nThe accompanying measures referred to in Article 7 and described in Annex I will in particular be implemented through:\n- the organization of seminars, workshops and scientific conferences;\n- internal coordination through the creation of integrating groups (in particular between testing laboratories);\n- training of specialists;\n- storage and dissemination of the reference materials certified at Community level;\n- promotion of the exploitation of results;\n- independent scientific and strategic evaluation of the operation of the projects and the programme.\n3. The knowledge acquired in the course of the projects will be disseminated both within the specific programme and by means of a centralized activity, pursuant to the Decision referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 4 of Decision  90/221/Euratom, EEC."}
