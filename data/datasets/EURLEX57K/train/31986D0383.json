Purpose of the programme (processing)\nProvision of support for plans and initiatives by the French fish-processing industry in so far as such plans and initiatives contribute towards:\n- the upgrading of fish,\n- the development of industries producing goods with a high added value;\n- the improvement of the competitiveness of processing firms;\n- a reduction in the trade deficit with third countries.\n2. Delimitation of the area concerned by the programme\nThe whole of Metropolitan France.\n3. Duration of the programme\nThe programme covers the period from 1 January 1986 to 31 December 1990.\n4. Objectives of the programme\nThe main emphasis will be placed on the following aspects:\n- in the canning industry:\n- the maintenance of relations with suppliers once they have become competitive in terms of price and quality,\n- the modernization of industrial plant,\n- the development of new products;\n- in the deep-freeze sector:\n- the improvement of supply sources and/or extension of existing processing plants to provide adequate intake and storage facilities,\n- the investment in high-performance equipment,\n- the development of a brand policy,\n- the use of refrigeration and freezing techniques to increase the market value of species with little or no market value in the fresh state.\n5. Investment forecasts\nThe total investment figure needed in order to attain the specified objectives is FF 450 million (67 million ECU), broken down as follows:\n1. Investments needed to develop canning firms:\nindustrial investments FF 240 million,\n2. Investments in the freezing and deep-freeze sector:\nindustrial investment FF 160 million,\n3.

National aid\nThe State may also grant a subsidy or loans at favourable rates or on favourable repayment terms. Fish-processing undertakings are eligible for these loans in the same way as any other food-processing undertaking.\nANNEX III\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission considers that the programmes forwarded by France as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes, constitute a suitable basis to facilitate the development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\nIn this connection, the Commission emphasizes the importance of the prospective development of resources and of the consequences and objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture for the future development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\n2. Given that the structural measurs for the restructuring of the fishing fleet and aquaclture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission reserves the possibility of reviewing the current programme at a later date in order that the structural measures relating to the fishing fleet and aquaculture foreseen for 1987 and later may be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner in relation to the processing and marketing of fish products.\n3. However, the Commission points out that: investments relating to the establishment of technical assistance centres are not eligible for grant aid under Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77.\nFurthermore, investments in products for human consumption which are not listed in Annex II of the EEC Treaty shall be examined with particular reference to Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77; these should contain significant amounts of fish.\n4. Taking into account the present situation in the Community market for sardines tinned in traditional form, the Commission affirms that in the implementation of the current programmes no aid should be granted to investments increasing the production capacity of this type of product."}
