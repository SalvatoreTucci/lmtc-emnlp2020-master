This arrangement should be implemented.\n(3) Since vessels that targeted hake with gill-nets in ICES Divisions VIa, b and VIIb, c, j, k and subarea XII were not implicated in the fishing practices that led to the prohibition of the use of gill-nets in those areas, it is appropriate to allow these fisheries to continue by way of derogation from the prohibition.\n(4) The Community has held consultations with Norway on the management of fisheries on the stock of Norwegian spring spawning (Atlanto-Scandian) herring in the North-East Atlantic, in particular, with regard to licensing arrangements, which should be implemented.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 51/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annexes IA, IB and IV to Regulation (EC) No 51/2006 shall be amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 1 June 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nU.
