This quantity meets the criteria laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must accordingly be added to the quantity of 1\u00a0122\u00a0445 tonnes.\n(6) In consequence, using fibre yield as a quality criterion, actual Greek production of unginned cotton for the 2005/06 marketing year must be considered to total 1\u00a0124\u00a0714 tonnes.\n(7) The Spanish authorities, using fibre yield as a quality criterion, have recognised 355\u00a0348 tonnes of unginned cotton as eligible for aid.\n(8) The Spanish authorities have informed the Commission that on 15 May 2006 they did not recognise as eligible for aid 1\u00a0708 tonnes of unginned cotton consisting of 1\u00a0482 tonnes in respect of which national area reduction measures under Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 were disregarded, 21 tonnes that were not of sound and fair merchantable quality in accordance with Article 15(1) of that Regulation, 75 tonnes that were not declared in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001, 120 tonnes that were damaged by fire and 10 tonnes because the rules concerning contracts referred to in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 were not complied with.\n(9) Exclusion from actual production of the abovementioned 10 tonnes of unginned cotton on account of non-compliance with the rules concerning contracts and of the 120 tonnes that were damaged by fire are not justified. Moreover, those quantities meet the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must therefore be added to the quantity of 355\u00a0348 tonnes.\n(10) In consequence, by application of fibre yield as a quality criterion, actual Spanish production of unginned cotton in the 2005/06 marketing year must be considered to total 355\u00a0482 tonnes.\n(11) The Spanish authorities, using fibre yield as a quality criterion, have recognised 440 tonnes of unginned cotton from crop areas in Portugal as eligible for aid. This quantity meets the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must accordingly be regarded as actual Portuguese production of unginned cotton for the 2005/06 marketing year.\n(12) Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 provides that if the sum of the actual production determined for Spain and Greece exceeds 1\u00a0031\u00a0000 tonnes the guide price indicated in Article 3(1) of that Regulation is to be reduced in any Member State where actual production exceeds the guaranteed national quantity.\n(13) Moreover, if the sum of actual production in Spain and Greece reduced by 1\u00a0031\u00a0000 tonnes is higher than 469\u00a0000 tonnes, the reduction in the guide price of 50\u00a0% increases gradually in accordance with the rules laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001.\n(14) For the 2005/06 marketing year the guaranteed national quantity is exceeded in both Spain and Greece. Actual production in Spain is below its guaranteed national quantity increased by 113\u00a0000 tonnes. As a result, the guide price reduction in Spain should be equal to 50\u00a0% of the rate of overshot. In the case of Greece, actual production is as well as below its guaranteed national quantity increased by 356\u00a0000 tonnes. As a result, the guide price reduction in Greece should be equal to 50\u00a0% of the rate of overshot.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Natural Fibres,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2005/06 marketing year actual production of unginned cotton is hereby determined as:\n\u2014 1\u00a0124\u00a0714 tonnes for Greece,\n\u2014 355\u00a0482 tonnes for Spain,\n\u2014 440 tonnes for Portugal.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount by which the guide price is to be reduced for the 2005/06 marketing year shall be:\n\u2014 Greece: EUR 23,280 per 100 kg of unginned cotton,\n\u2014 Spain: EUR 22,748 per 100 kg of unginned cotton,\n\u2014 Portugal: EUR 0 per 100 kg of unginned cotton.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 June 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Protocol as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1050/2001 (OJ L 148, 1.6.2001, p. 1).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 1.6.2001, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 210, 3.8.2001, p. 10.
