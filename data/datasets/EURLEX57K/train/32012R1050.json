That food additive has subsequently been authorised on the basis of specific uses and has been allocated the number E 964 by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1049/2012 of 8 November 2012 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the use of polyglycitol syrup in several food categories\u00a0(5). Therefore specifications should be adopted for that food additive.\n(3) It is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for additives as proposed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 83, 22.3.2012, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS); Scientific Opinion on the use of Polyglycitol Syrup as a food additive on request from the European Commission.

It is manufactured by the catalytic hydrogenation of a mixture of starch hydrolysates consisting of glucose, maltose and higher glucose polymers, similar to the catalytic hydrogenation process used for the manufacture of maltitol syrup. The resulting syrup is desalted by ion exchange and concentrated to the desired level.\nEinecs\nChemical name Sorbitol: D-glucitol\nMaltitol: (\u03b1)-D-Glucopyranosyl-1,4-D-glucitol\nChemical formula Sorbitol: C6H14O6\nMaltitol: C12H24O11\nMolecular weight Sorbitol: 182,2\nMaltitol: 344,3\nAssay Content not less than 99\u00a0% of total hydrogenated saccharides on the anhydrous basis, not less than 50\u00a0% higher molecular weight polyols, not more than 50\u00a0% of maltitol and not more than 20\u00a0% of sorbitol on the anhydrous basis.\nDescription Colourless and odourless clear viscous liquid\nIdentification\nSolubility Very soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol\nTest for maltitol Passes test\nTest for sorbitol To 5\u00a0g of the sample add 7\u00a0ml of methanol, 1\u00a0ml of benzaldehyde and 1\u00a0ml of hydrochloric acid.
