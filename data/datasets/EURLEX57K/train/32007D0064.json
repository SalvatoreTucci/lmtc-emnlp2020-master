That Decision replaced Decision 2001/688/EC in so far as soil improvers were concerned.\n(3) However, it is necessary to replace Decision 2001/688/EC in so far as growing media are concerned.\n(4) In the light of the review, it is appropriate, in order to take account of scientific and market developments, to revise the criteria and requirements relating to growing media, the period of validity of which expires on 28 August 2007.\n(5) The revised ecological criteria and requirements should be valid for a period of four years.\n(6) It is appropriate to allow a transitional period of not more than eighteen months for producers whose products have been awarded the eco-label before 1 October 2006 or who have applied for such an award before that date, so that they have sufficient time to adapt their products to comply with the revised criteria and requirements.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,", "main_body": ["The product group \u2018growing media\u2019 shall comprise material other than soils in situ, in which plants are grown.", "In order to be awarded the Community eco-label for growing media, under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a product must fall within the product group \u2018growing media\u2019 as defined in Article 1, and must comply with the ecological criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "The environmental performance of the product group \u2018growing media\u2019 shall be assessed by reference to the specific ecological criteria set out in the Annex.", "For administrative purposes, the code number assigned to the product group \u2018growing media\u2019 shall be \u2018029\u2019", "Eco-labels awarded before 1 October 2006 in respect of products falling within the product group \u2018soil improvers and growing media\u2019 may continue to be used until 30 April 2008.\nWhere applications have been submitted before 1 October 2006 for award of the eco-label in respect of products falling within the product group \u2018soil improvers and growing media\u2019, those products may be awarded the eco-label under the conditions applicable until 28 August 2007.
