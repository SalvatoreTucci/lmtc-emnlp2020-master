(2) OJ No L 54, 5.3.1979, p. 99.\nWhereas experience acquired in the sale of certain products has shown that, in order to provide purchasers with fuller information, provision should be made for the possibility of indicating not only the total alcoholic strength by volume but also the actual alcoholic strength by volume;\nWhereas details concerning the manner of manufacture, the type of the product or a particular colour are permitted at present for certain imported wines bearing a geographical indication ; whereas this is permitted subject to the condition that the said information is traditionally employed, and defined by provisions in the third country of origin ; whereas this provision imposes a heavy burden of supervision on national administrations ; whereas it is therefore proper to provide for a legal basis which will also make it possible to define the said details by means of Community provisions, retaining nevertheless the right to prohibit them in certain cases where the statements are not traditional or might be a source of confusion;\nWhereas, for imported wines other than those referred to above, the said details are not permitted at present ; whereas experience has shown that, with regard to the said imported wines, the consumer needs to be better informed as to the type of wine ; whereas therefore, provision should be made for allowing the use of such information in respect of the said wines,", "main_body": ["Article 2 (1) (d) of Regulation (EEC) No 355/79 is hereby replaced by the following text:\n\"(d) in the case of:    (i) consignment to another Member State or export : the Member State in whose territory the grapes were harvested and turned into wine, provided that both these operations took place in the same Member State;\n(ii) table wine which was made in a Member State other than that in which the grapes were harvested : the initials \"EEC\";\n(iii) table wine resulting from coupage:      - of products originating in more than one Member State,\n- of a table wine referred to in (ii) above with another table wine or with another product with which coupage is permitted for the production of a table wine,\nthe words \"wine from different countries of the European Community\";\"", "The following shall be added to Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 355/79:\n\"(e) in the case of the table wines referred to in the third indent of point 11 of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 : the word \"retsina\".\"", "1.
