The first means of identification are eartags and the second means of identification are set out in point 4 of Section A of the Annex to that Regulation. One of the second means of identification is an electronic transponder. In addition, Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 provides that, as from 1 January 2008 or another date that may be fixed by the Council, electronic identification as a second means of identification is to be obligatory for all animals.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 provides for the adoption by the Commission of guidelines and procedures for the implementation of the electronic identification in order to improve its implementation. Those guidelines and procedures should be applied for those animals for which electronic identification is already used as the second means of identification and for all animals as from the date provided for in Article 9(3) of that Regulation.\n(4) In order to ensure that the identifiers to be applied to ovine and caprine animals for the purpose of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 are readable in all Member States, minimum requirements concerning certain conformance and performance tests should be laid down in this Decision for the approval of identifiers.\n(5) In order to provide guidance to the Member States as regards readers, minimum requirements concerning certain conformance and performance tests should be laid down in this Decision taking into account that Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 does not foresee that every operator must possess a reader.\n(6) Due to the different geographic conditions and husbandry systems under which ovine and caprine animals are kept in the Community, the Member States should have the possibility to require additional performance tests taking into account their specific national conditions.\n(7) The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published standards dealing with aspects of radio frequency identification (RFID) of animals. In addition, the International Committee on Animal Recording (ICAR) has developed procedures aimed to verify the compliance of certain RFID characteristics with ISO standards. Those procedures have been published in the International Agreement on Recording Practices in the version as approved by the ICAR General Assembly, June 2004. The ISO standards are accepted and used internationally and should therefore be taken into account in this Decision.\n(8) The Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the Commission has developed Technical Guidelines specifying tests for assessing the performance and reliability of RFID devices that are published on the JRC website as JRC technical standards. The essential elements of those guidelines should be taken into account in this Decision.\n(9) The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has published technical standards dealing with the accreditation of test laboratories. Those standards (EN standards) are accepted and used internationally and should therefore be taken into account in this Decision.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to this Decision sets out the guidelines and procedures for the electronic identification of animals:\n(a) for the second means of identification, as provided for in Article 4(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 and referred to in the fourth indent of point 4 of Section A of the Annex to that Regulation; and\n(b) provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004.", "This Decision shall apply from the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 5, 9.1.2004, p. 8.\nANNEX\nGuidelines and procedures for the approval of identifiers and readers for the electronic identification of ovine and caprine animals pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004\nCHAPTER I\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018Country code\u2019 means a 3-digit numeric code representing the name of a country in accordance with ISO standard 3166;\n(b) \u2018National identification code\u2019 means a 12-digit numeric code to identify an individual animal at national level;\n(c) \u2018Transponder code\u2019 means the 64-bit electronic code programmed in the transponder and containing inter alia the country code and national identification code and used for the electronic identification of animals;\n(d) \u2018Identifier\u2019 means a read-only passive transponder applying the HDX- or FDX-B technology as defined in ISO standards 11784 and 11785 and incorporated in different means of identification as referred to in Annex A of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004;\n(e) \u2018Reader\u2019 means a synchronising or non-synchronising transceiver which is, at least, capable of:\n(i) reading identifiers; and\n(ii) displaying the country code and the national identification code;\n(f) \u2018Synchronising transceiver\u2019 means a transceiver, which fully complies with ISO standard 11785 and is able to detect the presence of other transceivers;\n(g) \u2018Non-synchronising transceiver\u2019 means a transceiver, which does not comply with clause 6 of ISO standard 11785 and is not able to detect the presence of other transceivers.\nCHAPTER II\nIdentifiers\n1.
