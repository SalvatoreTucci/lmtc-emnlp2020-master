The maximum quantity that may be taken over by the intervention agency under Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 shall be obtained by multiplying the total quantity of wine delivered by the maximum alcoholic strength specified in Article 1 (1) and dividing the result by the alcoholic strength of the product obtained from distillation that is delivered.\n3.
