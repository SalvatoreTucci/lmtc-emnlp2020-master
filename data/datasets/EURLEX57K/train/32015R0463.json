The application was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article\u00a04 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.\n(4) The current specification as regards the solubility of the food additive polyvinyl alcohol (E 1203) states \u2018Soluble in water; sparingly soluble in ethanol\u2019. The Institute for Health and Consumer Protection (IHCP) of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre carried out solubility studies\u00a0(4) of polyvinyl alcohol to update the solubility data of the existing Union specifications vis-\u00e0-vis its solubility in ethanol.\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) evaluated the results of the solubility test with polyvinyl alcohol carried out by the IHCP and the information provided by the applicant\u00a0(5). The Authority considers that the modification of the specification on the solubility of polyvinyl alcohol in ethanol has no impact on the safety of polyvinyl alcohol as a food additive.\n(6) Taking into account the submitted application, the studies carried out by the IHCP and the evaluation made by the Authority, it is appropriate to amend the description of the solubility of the food additive polyvinyl alcohol (E 1203) in ethanol (\u2265\u00a099,8 %) to \u2018practically insoluble or insoluble\u2019.\n(7) Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 of 9 March 2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a083, 22.3.2012, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Jo\u00e3o F.
