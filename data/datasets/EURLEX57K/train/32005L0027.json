The provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to Directive 2003/97/EC.\n(2) In order to reduce the blind spot of N2 vehicles of mass not exceeding 7,5 tonnes, it is necessary to modify certain requirements laid down in Directive 2003/97/EC.\n(3) Since 2003, technical progress with regard to rear view mirrors has advanced considerably. It is now possible to install wide-angle rear-view mirrors on some N2 vehicles of mass not exceeding 7,5 tonnes. It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 2003/97/EC by extending the obligation to fit Class IV wide-angle mirrors to those vehicles of category N2 having a cabin similar to that of N3 vehicles. The appropriate criterion for distinguishing the two types of N2 vehicles should be whether a class V close-proximity mirror can be fitted.\n(4) Vehicles having seats with a fixed seat-back angle would not be able to fulfil the standard requirements. A correction factor for such vehicles should therefore be introduced.\n(5) It is also appropriate to amend the administrative provisions for type-approval by introducing the distinguishing numbers of the Member States which acceded to the Community on 1 May 2004.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and III to Directive 2003/97/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 19 October 2005 at the latest.
