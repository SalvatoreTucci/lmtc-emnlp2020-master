However, experience has shown that what appear at first sight to be minor post-marketing changes to the design of previously trouble-free replacements can lead to serious problems due to unintended consequences, which may lead to early failure and major safety concerns.\n(11) In order to achieve the optimal level of safety and health protection and to reduce the design related problems to the lowest level, the design dossier of hip, knee and shoulder replacements, including the clinical data used by the manufacturer to support the claimed performance and the subsequent post-marketing design and manufacturing changes should be examined in detail by the notified body before these devices are introduced in general clinical use.\n(12) Consequently, the notified body should, under the full quality assurance system, effectively carry out an examination of the design dossier and of the changes to the approved design in accordance with point 4 of Annex II to Directive 93/42/EEC.\n(13) For these reasons, it is necessary to proceed to the reclassification of hip, knee and shoulder total joint replacements as class III medical devices.\n(14) It is necessary to provide for an adequate transitional period for hip, knee and shoulder total joint replacements already assessed as class IIb medical devices under the full quality assurance system of Annex II to Directive 93/42/EEC, allowing for their complementary assessment under point 4 of Annex II to the Directive.\n(15) Hip, knee and shoulder total joint replacements already certified following the procedure relating to the EC type examination set out in Annex III to Directive 93/42/EEC, coupled with the procedure relating to the EC verification set out in Annex IV or the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex V to that Directive, are not affected by the present Directive as these certification schemes are the same for both class IIb and class III medical devices.\n(16) It is necessary to provide for an adequate transitional period for hip, knee and shoulder total joint replacements that have already been subject to the procedure relating to the EC type examination under Annex III to Directive 93/42/EEC coupled with the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex VI to that Directive, allowing for their assessment under Annex IV or Annex V to Directive 93/42/EEC.\n(17) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Medical Devices set up by Article 6(2) of Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from the rules set out in Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC, hip, knee and shoulder replacements shall be reclassified as medical devices falling within class III.", "For the purpose of this Directive, a hip, knee or shoulder replacement means an implantable component part of a total joint replacement system which is intended to provide a function similar to that of either a natural hip joint, a natural knee joint or a natural shoulder joint.
