Any delay in making available those adjustments on the date or dates communicated to the Commission should give rise to interest under the conditions of Article\u00a011 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01150/2000.\n(6) The amounts to be made available on the first working day of December\u00a02014 as a result of adjustments are of\u00a0an unprecedented size, a situation that could not have been foreseen when Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01150/2000 was adopted.\n(7) In order to prevent this exceptional and unforeseen situation from creating unreasonably heavy budgetary constraints on Member States just before the year-end, the option provided for in this Regulation should be applicable for adjustments which, pursuant to Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01150/2000, had to be entered in the Commission's accounts on the first working day of\u00a0December\u00a02014. In this regard, the Member States wishing to benefit from that option have already transmitted a formal request with a payment schedule to the Commission before the first working day of December 2014.\n(8) Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01150/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Article\u00a010 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01150/2000, the following paragraph is inserted:\n\u20187a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the rules laid down in paragraphs\u00a04 to\u00a07 of this Article, a Member\u00a0State may, by formal request to the Commission, enter in the account referred to in Article\u00a09(1) amounts to be credited to the Commission pursuant to those paragraphs until the first working day of\u00a0September of the following year, if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n(a) the Member\u00a0State concerned would have to enter in the account referred to in Article\u00a09(1) on the first working day of\u00a0December an amount exceeding two twelfths of the total for that Member\u00a0State in the budget for VAT resources and the additional resource, as referred to in paragraph\u00a03, first subparagraph, of this Article, as applicable on\u00a015\u00a0November of the same year, or\n(b) Member\u00a0States in total would have to enter in the account referred to in Article\u00a09(1) on the first working day of\u00a0December a total amount exceeding one half of a twelfth of the total in the budget for VAT resources and the additional resource, as referred to in paragraph\u00a03, first subparagraph, of this Article and applying the exchange rates defined in that subparagraph, as applicable on\u00a015\u00a0November of the same year.\nMember\u00a0States may only apply the first subparagraph of this paragraph if they have transmitted the formal request to the Commission before the first working day of\u00a0December with a payment schedule, containing the date or dates of entry of the amount of the adjustments in the account referred to in Article\u00a09(1).\nUpon receipt of a formal request the Commission shall confirm that the conditions set out in point (a) or (b) of the\u00a0first\u00a0subparagraph and in the second subparagraph have been fulfilled and shall notify the Member States accordingly.\nAny delay in entering the amount of the adjustments in the account referred to in Article\u00a09(1) on the date or dates communicated to the Commission under the second subparagraph of this paragraph shall give rise to the payment of interest by the Member\u00a0State concerned under the conditions set out in Article\u00a011.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to amounts to be entered into the accounts referred to in Article\u00a09(1) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01150/2000 after\u00a030\u00a0November\u00a02014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member\u00a0States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nS.
