It was discovered that all available stocks of milk powder in that country were contaminated with chloramphenicol and that the exporting firms concerned were no longer able to deliver the quantities for which contracts had been concluded before the end of the period of validity of the licences.\n(5) The validity of the import licences issued in July 2002 under quota No 09.4549 for imports originating in Latvia should therefore be extended to 30 June 2003.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["1.
