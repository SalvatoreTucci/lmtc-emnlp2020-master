Under the bilateral Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation, signed in Luxembourg on 21 June 1999, refunds for cheese exported to Switzerland will be abolished with effect from the date of entry into force of the Agreement, which is currently being ratified. Article 17 of the Agreement provides for its entry into force on the first day of the second month following the final notification of the deposit of the instruments of ratification or approval of all the agreements referred to in that Article. In order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Agreement in this regard, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2594/2001(5), which derogates from Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, shortens the period of validity of the licences concerned so that, when the Agreement enters into force, licences issued with advance fixing of the refund with Switzerland as their destination will no longer be valid. However, as Switzerland falls within the \"other destinations\" zone and forms a customs union with Liechtenstein, under Article 15(1) of the above Regulation a licence issued for a destination other than Switzerland could conceivably be used for exports to Switzerland or for exports to Liechtenstein with a view to their placement on the Swiss market. To prevent this risk of diversion, two specific zones should be created, one for Switzerland and one for Liechtenstein.\n(2) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk products,", "main_body": ["Article 15(3) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 is replaced by the following: \"3.
