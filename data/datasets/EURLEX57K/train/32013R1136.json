Applications have been submitted for the renewal of the approval of these active substances. As the requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012\u00a0(3) apply to those active substances, it is necessary to allow applicants sufficient time to complete the renewal procedure in accordance with that Regulation. Consequently, the approvals of those active substances are likely to expire before a decision has been taken on their renewal. It is therefore necessary to extend their approval periods.\n(3) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) In view of the aim of the first paragraph of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as regards cases where no supplementary dossier in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012 is submitted no later than 30 months before the respective expiry date laid down in the Annex to this Regulation, the Commission will set the expiry date at the same date as before this Regulation or at the earliest date thereafter.\n(5) In view of the aim of the first paragraph of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as regards cases where the Commission will adopt a Regulation providing that the approval of an active substance referred to in the Annex to this Regulation is not renewed because the approval criteria are not satisfied, the Commission will set the expiry date at the same date as before this Regulation or at the date of the entry into force of the Regulation providing that the approval of the active substance is not renewed, whichever date is later.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012 of 18 September 2012 setting out the provisions necessary for the implementation of the renewal procedure for active substances, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ L 252, 19.9.2012, p. 26).\nANNEX\nPart A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) in the sixth column, expiration of approval, of row 116, oxamyl, the date 31 July 2016 is replaced by 31 January 2018;\n(2) in the sixth column, expiration of approval, of row 121, clothianidin, the date 31 July 2016 is replaced by 31 January 2018;\n(3) in the sixth column, expiration of approval, of row 122, pethoxamid, the date 31 July 2016 is replaced by 31 January 2018;\n(4) in the sixth column, expiration of approval, of row 128, dimoxystrobin, the date 30 September 2016 is replaced by 31 January 2018."}
