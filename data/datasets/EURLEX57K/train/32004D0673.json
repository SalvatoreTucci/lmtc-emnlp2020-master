At present Malta does not use natural gas because it has no gas network or connection.\n(4) Moreover, the VAT rules regarding the place of supply of electricity, as laid down in the Sixth VAT Directive, were amended by Directive 2003/92/EC\u00a0(3). The supply of electricity in the final stage, from traders and distributors to final consumer, is taxed at the place where the customer has effective use and consumption of the goods, in order to ensure that taxation takes place in the country where actual consumption takes place.\n(5) Since the measure is a general one with no provision for exceptions, the risk of distortion of competition must be deemed non-existent. Since the condition laid down by Article 12(3)(b) of the Sixth Directive is thus fulfilled, Malta should be able to apply the measure concerned as soon as this Decision is notified,", "main_body": ["Malta may apply the measure notified in its letter of 18 June 2004, applying a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of electricity irrespective of the conditions of production and supply.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Malta."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 August 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFrederik BOLKESTEIN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 145, 13.6.1977, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 168, 1.5.2004, p. 35.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 260, 11.10.2003, p. 8."}
