This would imply an abrupt change and not allow a smooth transition for the feed business operators placing feed on the market. Switching the design and production of labels and the conversion of the existing machinery from one day to the other would be expensive for those businesses. The resulting burden would be disproportionate to the objective of the change. It is therefore appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which feed may be labelled in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 before 1 September 2010.\n(3) As regards feed intended for pet animals, the market consists of a huge number of different products with specific labels. Compared with the current labelling rules for pet food, only Articles 15(f), 17(1)(f) and 19 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 will introduce changes to the labelling of those products, representing only minor changes with no effect on safety. In order to allow a smooth transition for the feed business operators concerned, it is justified to provide for a transitional period of 1 year during which the current labels for pet food may continue to be used after 1 September 2010.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from the second paragraph of Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 and without prejudice to Council Directives 79/373/EEC\u00a0(2), 82/471/EEC\u00a0(3), 93/74/EEC\u00a0(4) and 96/25/EC\u00a0(5), feed labelled in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 may be placed on the market as from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.", "By way of derogation from the second paragraph of Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009, feed intended for pet animals and labelled in accordance with Directive 79/373/EEC and Article 16 of Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(6) may be placed on the market until 31 August 2011.
