When establishing the monitoring procedure to ensure that the values of CO2 emissions, fuel efficiency and mass of completed vehicles are representative, the method for determining the mass and CO2 values should be set out, if appropriate, based on a table of CO2 values corresponding to different final inertia weight classes or based on only one CO2 value derived from the base vehicle mass plus a default added mass differentiated by N1 class.\n(5) On the basis of those alternative methods, indicated in point 7 of Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, different options were considered and assessed in terms of accuracy, representativeness and feasibility. The option based on testing the base vehicle with a single estimated mass value, where the component corresponding to the bodywork is calculated by applying a polynomial formula dependent of the reference mass of the base vehicle, presents the best balance between accuracy in terms of CO2 emissions determination from the completed vehicle, costs involved, and ease of implementation.\n(6) In order to ensure that the performance of vehicle manufacturers in reducing CO2 emissions pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 can be adequately and efficiently monitored, it is necessary to include the relevant information in the certificate of conformity.\n(7) Sufficient lead time should be given in order to allow manufacturers and national authorities to adapt their procedures to the new rules.\n(8) In the light of the experience gained from the application of the procedure for determining the CO2 emissions from completed vehicles and the monitoring of those emissions, it is appropriate to review the procedure and evaluate the representativeness of the CO2 emissions as well as the efficacy and accuracy of the monitoring of CO2 emissions at the latest by the end of 2016.\n(9) Directive 2007/46/EC and Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee \u2013 Motor Vehicles,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and IX to Directive 2007/46/EC are amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annexes I and XII to Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 are amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "The Commission shall assess the need to review the procedure set out in points 5.1 to 5.7 of Annex XII to Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 as amended by this Regulation.\nOn the basis of that assessment and no later than 31 December 2016, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council accompanied, if appropriate, by any appropriate proposals.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a transitional period until 1 January 2014, certificates of conformity of base vehicles of category N1 within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 issued in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC and Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 before the amendments introduced by this Regulation, shall continue to be valid.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a transitional period until 1 January 2014, certificates of conformity of completed vehicles of category N1 within scope of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 issued in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC and Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 before the amendments introduced by this Regulation, shall continue to be valid.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 January 2013, national authorities shall consider certificates of conformity complying with the requirements set out in this Regulation to be valid.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014, with the exception of Article 4(3) which shall apply from 1 January 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 171, 29.6.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 199, 28.7.2008, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 145, 31.5.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nAnnexes I and IX to Directive 2007/46/EC are amended as follows:\n(1) in Annex I, the following points 2.17, 2.17.1 and 2.17.2 are added:\n(2) Annex IX is amended as follows:\n(a) Part I, Complete and completed vehicles, is amended as follows:\n(i) in Model B \u2013 Side 1, Completed vehicles, EC certificate of conformity, the following point 0.2.2 is inserted:\n\u20180.2.2.
