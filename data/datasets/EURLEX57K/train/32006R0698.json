If the information is not available for all mandatory variables, the calculation shall be based on those mandatory variables for which the necessary information is available.\n2.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Model assumption errors\nIf modelling is used, the quality reports on structural statistics on labour costs and earnings respectively shall include a description of the models used and an indication of their effects on the estimates (e.g. estimated share of the variable's total), at least for the variables \u2018Annual labour costs\u2019 and \u2018Gross earnings in the reference month\u2019 respectively as defined in point 2.1.\nParticular emphasis shall be given to models for the correction of non-sampling errors such as coverage of units of all requested size classes or NACE sections, imputation or grossing-up to correct for unit non-response.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Punctuality and timeliness\n\u2018Punctuality\u2019 refers to the time lag between the release date of data and the target date when it should have been delivered, for instance with reference to dates announced in official release calendars, laid down by Regulations or previously agreed among partners.\n\u2018Timeliness\u2019 of information reflects the length of time between its availability and the event or phenomenon it describes.\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Punctuality\nIn order to understand and to remove problems related to punctuality, information shall be delivered on the process of the survey implementation at national level with a special emphasis on the correspondence between scheduled and actual dates:\n\u2014 deadlines for the respondents to reply, also covering recalls and follow-ups,\n\u2014 period of the fieldwork,\n\u2014 period of data processing,\n\u2014 dates of publication of first results.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timeliness\nThe quality reports on structural statistics on labour costs and earnings respectively shall contain information on the length of time between the release of data and the reference period of the data at national level.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accessibility and clarity\n\u2018Accessibility\u2019 refers to the physical conditions in which users can obtain data: where to go, how to get access, delivery time, convenient marketing conditions (copyright, etc.), availability of micro or macro data, various formats and data carriers (paper, files, CD-ROM/DVD, Internet), etc.\n\u2018Clarity\u2019 refers to the degree of comprehensibility, including data information environment, i.e. whether data are accompanied by appropriate metadata, illustrations such as graphs and maps, whether information on their quality is available (including limitations on use) and the extent to which additional assistance is provided.\nBy way of derogation from Article 2, information on accessibility and clarity shall be transmitted to Eurostat at the latest 36 months after the end of the reference period.\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accessibility\nThe quality reports on structural statistics on labour costs and earnings respectively shall contain the following information on the dissemination modes of the results:\n\u2014 references for core results publications, including those with commentary in the form of text, graphs, maps, etc,\n\u2014 information on what results, if any, are sent to reporting units included in the sample.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clarity\nThe quality reports on structural statistics on labour costs and earnings respectively shall contain the following information on the comprehensibility of the results and the availability of metadata:\n\u2014 description of and references for metadata provided,\n\u2014 references for core methodological documents relating to the statistics provided,\n\u2014 description of main actions carried out by the national statistical services to inform users about links to the data.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comparability\n\u2018Comparability\u2019 aims at measuring the impact of differences in applied statistical concepts and measurement tools/procedures when statistics are compared between geographical areas, non-geographical domains, or over time.\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geographical comparability\nThe quality reports on structural statistics on labour costs and earnings respectively shall contain information on differences between national and European concepts, especially on the definition of statistical units, populations, reference times, classifications and definitions of variables, and their effects on the estimates.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comparability over time\nThe quality reports on structural statistics on labour costs and earnings respectively shall contain information on changes in definitions, coverage and methods compared with previous surveys, and their effects on the estimates. Information on changes in definitions, coverage and methods, however, is not requested when these changes are the result of amendments to Community legislation.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coherence\n\u2018Coherence\u2019 of statistics is the extent to which they can be reliably combined in different ways and for various uses. It is, however, generally easier to identify cases of incoherence than to prove coherence.\nSources with similar or even identical variables to structural statistics on earnings and labour costs are the Labour Force Survey (LFS), Structure of Business Statistics (SBS), Labour Cost Index (LCI) and National Accounts (NA). The quality reports on structural statistics on labour costs and earnings respectively shall contain comparisons of data on the following variables from these sources, in total and broken down by NACE sections, and give indications of the reasons if the values differ considerably.\n(1) In the case of structural statistics on labour costs, comparisons shall be made between:\n\u2014 the number of hours actually worked in the reference year, expressed per employee\u00a0(11), and the average actual hours worked in the main job per year of the LFS, again expressed per employee,\n\u2014 the variable \u2018wages and salaries\u2019, expressed per employee\u00a0(12), and the same variable, per employee of the SBS,\n\u2014 the average annual growth rates of the variable \u2018hourly labour costs\u2019\u00a0(13) and the average annual growth rate of the unadjusted LCI. The growth rates should refer to the reference year of the survey and that of the previous survey,\n\u2014 the variable \u2018compensation of employees\u2019, expressed per employee\u00a0(14), and the same variable of the NA.\n(2) In the case of structural statistics on earnings, comparisons shall be made between:\n\u2014 the variable \u2018gross annual earnings in the reference year\u2019, expressed per employee\u00a0(15), and the variable \u2018wages and salaries\u2019, per employee, of the NA.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the square root of the variance of the estimator to its expected value. It is estimated by the ratio of the square root of the estimate of the sampling variance to its estimated mean. Both numerator and denominator of the ratio defining the coefficient of variation should be provided, together with the resulting coefficient of variation. The estimation of the sampling variance must take the sampling design into account.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Code D (total labour costs), the sum of the values of codes D1, D2, D3 and D4 minus D5 in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Code D (total labour costs), the sum of the values of codes D1, D2, D3 and D4 minus D5, divided by the value of code B1, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Code 4.2 (total gross earnings in the reference month) in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1916/2000.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Code 4.3 in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1916/2000.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Under-coverage\u2019 refers to units erroneously not included in the frame. \u2018Over-coverage\u2019 relates either to units that are in fact out of scope or to units that do not exist in practice.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0Measurement errors are errors that occur at the time of data collection. There are a number of sources of measurement errors, including the survey instrument, the respondent, the information system, the mode of data collection and the interviewer. Processing errors are errors in post-data-collection processes such as data entry, coding, keying, editing, weighting and tabulating.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0The unit response rate is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the number of responses to the total number of in-scope respondents.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0The item imputation rate gives the imputed values for a specific variable as a percentage of the total number of values for this variable.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0The overall imputation rate gives the imputed values for all variables as a percentage of the total number of values for these variables.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0Code B1, divided by the value of code A1, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0Code D11, divided by the value of code A1, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0As defined in point 2.1.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0Code D1, divided by the value of code A1, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999.\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0Code 4.1, divided by the number of employees, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1916/2000."}
