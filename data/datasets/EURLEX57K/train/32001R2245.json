The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has requested a 20 % increase in those quotas.\n(5) It is appropriate to increase the levels of all quotas for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as was done for Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina for the year 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 7/2000(5) prior to the negotiation of bilateral textile agreements with those two countries.\n(6) The starting point for determining that increase should be the quota growth rate per category which was foreseen in a Supplementary Protocol to the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on trade in textile products, concluded by Council Decision 90/649/EEC(6).\n(7) That across-the-board increase should be redistributed to the categories most needed, up to the limits of the increases requested by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n(8) The increased quota levels should apply from the beginning of the year 2001 in order to absorb certain pending import requests.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textiles Committee, as defined by Regulation (EC) No 517/94,", "main_body": ["Annexes IIIB and VI to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 are amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 January 2001.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 November 2001.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 67, 10.3.1994, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 333, 29.12.2000, p. 60.\n(3) OJ L 240, 23.9.2000, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 295, 23.11.2000, p. 1.\n(5) OJ L 2, 5.1.2000, p. 51.\n(6) OJ L 352, 15.12.1990, p. 120.\nANNEX\nAnnexes IIIB and VI to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 are amended as follows:\n1.
