As a consequence, it is no longer necessary to provide for observers to be present on the vessels using such gear.\n(7) Measures laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2549/2000 of 17 November 2000 establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES division VIIa)(4) regarding the insertion into beam trawls of panels of diamond-mesh netting material of large mesh size and insertion into otter trawls deployed for the capture of queen scallops of large mesh and square-mesh panels require to be amended to circumvent practical difficulties previously encountered.\n(8) Given the urgency of the measures to be taken, this Regulation should enter into force without delay,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down measures to protect mature cod during their spawning season of 2002 in the Irish Sea (ICES division VIIa as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the North-East Atlantic(5)).", "1.
