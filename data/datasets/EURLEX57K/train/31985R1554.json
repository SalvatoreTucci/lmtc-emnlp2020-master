This amount shall cover the fishing activities referred to in Article 1 up to, in the case of tuna fishing, a catch weight in the Seychelles fishing zone of 6\u00a0000 tonnes of tuna fish per year; if the amount of tuna caught by Community vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone exceeds this quantity, the abovementioned amount shall be increased accordingly; however, irrespective of the amount actually caught, the ceiling for financial compensation shall be fixed at 3\u00a0000\u00a0000 ECU for the duration of the Protocol, payable in three equal annual instalments."}
