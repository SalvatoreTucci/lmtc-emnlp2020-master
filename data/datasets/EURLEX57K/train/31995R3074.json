whereas, until such a  management regime is consolidated, limitation of exploitation rates should be guaranteed by the  current TAC system;\nWhereas, under the terms of Article 8 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92, it is incumbent upon the  Council, in accordance with Article 4, to determine for each fishery or group of fisheries the  total allowable catches (TAC); whereas fishing opportunities should by allocated to Member States  in accordance with Article 8 (4) (ii) of that Regulation;\nWhereas it is necessary to establish the principles and certain procedures of fishery management at  Community level, so that Member States can ensure the management of the fleets under their flag or  jurisdiction;\nWhereas, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 2 of the Agreement on fisheries  between the European Economic Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the  Home Government of the Faeroes, of the other part (2), the Parties have consulted on their  reciprocal fishing rights for 1996; whereas these consultations have been successfully concluded;  whereas, as a result, it is possible to fix the TACs, the Community shares and the quotas for  certain joint and autonomous stocks, of which part is allocated to the Faeroes;\nWhereas, in accordance with the procedure provided in Articles 2 and 7 of the Fisheries Agreement  between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway (3), the Community and Norway  have held consultations concerning mutual fishing rights for 1996; whereas these consultations have  been successfully concluded and therefore it is possible to fix the TACs, the Community shares and  the quotas for joint stocks and, where necessary, for other stocks;\nWhereas the Community has signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which  contains principles and rules relating to the conservation and management of the living resources  of the sea;\nWhereas, in the framework of its wider international obligations, the Community participates in  efforts to conserve fish stocks arising in international waters; whereas the extent to which such  stocks are fished by vessels of the Community should be viewed in the light of overall fishing  activity and the contribution made hitherto by the Community towards their conservation should be  taken into account;\nWhereas the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission has recommended TACs for the stocks of cod,  salmon, herring and sprat occurring in the waters of the Baltic Sea and the shares thereof for each  Contracting Party;\nWhereas, in the case of certain stocks fished mainly for reduction to meal and oil, it does not  appear necessary to make quota allocations,\nWhereas Article 161 of the 1985 Act of Accession fixes the share of the TACs allocated to Spain for  certain stocks in certain zones and allocates flat-rate amounts of horse mackerel and blue whiting  to Spain;\nWhereas those flat-rate amounts of blue whiting must be divided among ICES subareas and divisions V  b (EC zone), VI, VII and VIII a, b and d;\nWhereas, in order to ensure effective management of these TACs, the specific conditions under which  fishing operations occur should be established;\nWhereas, in order to ensure a better exploitation of the quotas of herring, anchovy, hake, blue  whiting, mackerel and megrim, transfers of a part of the quotas from the zone of allocation to  adjacent zones should be allowed;\nWhereas, in order to ensure a better exploitation of the haddock stocks in zones V b (EC zone), VI,  XII and XIV, catches in zones V b and VI a should be limited;\nWhereas massive catches of young flatfish are being taken in the southern North Sea in autumn;  whereas protection should be given to these fish, in order to achieve a better exploitation;\nWhereas the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission has recommended certain technical  measures for resource conservation to be implemented by its Contracting Parties with effect from 1  January 1996;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 122 of the 1994 Act of Accession, the conditions under which  allocations made in the framework of the Accession can be fished will remain identical to those  applicable immediately prior to the entry into force of the 1994 Treaty of Accession,\nWhereas improved economical utilization of certain stocks of herring requires them to be used for  purposes other than direct human consumption; whereas the state of these stocks is such that, under  appropriate management, there is no danger in implementing such a measure;\nWhereas the management regime set out by Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/95 of 15 June 1995  establishing a system for the management of fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing  areas and resources (1) requires the maintenance of the existing balances in fishing activities;  whereas, in the case of certain stocks of horse mackerel, these balances can be kept by setting  appropriate TACs and allocating them to the Member States concerned;\nWhereas the economical effectiveness of the fishery for horse mackerel in zones VIII c and IX may  be improved by the landing of small horse mackerel within limits compatible with the sustainability  of the resource,", "main_body": ["This Regulation fixes for 1996, for certain fish stocks and groups of  fish stocks, total allowable catches (TACs) per stock or group of stocks, the share of these  catches available to the Community, the allocation of that share among Member States and the  specific conditions under which these stocks may be fished (2).\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the Skagerrak is bounded on the west by a line drawn from the  Hanstholm lighthouse to the Lindesnes lighthouse and on the south by a line drawn from the Skagen  lighthouse to the Tistlarna lighthouse and from this point to the nearest point on the Swedish  coast.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the Kattegat is bounded on the north by a line drawn from the  Skagen lighthouse to the Tistlarna lighthouse and from this point to the nearest point on the  Swedish coast and on the south by a line drawn from Hasenoere to Gnibens Spids, from Korshage to  Spodsbjerg and from Gilbjerg Hoved to Kullen.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the North Sea shall comprise ICES subarea IV and that part of  ICES division III a which is not covered by the definition of the Skagerrak given in this Article.", "TACs for stocks or groups of stocks to which Community rules apply and the share of  these catches available to the Community are hereby fixed for 1996 as set out in the Annex.", "The allocation among the Member States of the share available to the Community of the  TACs mentioned in Article 2 is fixed for 1996, in the form of fish quotas, in the Annex.\nThis allocation shall be without prejudice to exchanges made pursuant to Article 9 (1) of  Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 and reallocations made pursuant to Articles 21 (4), 23 (1) and 32 (2)  of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable  to the common fisheries policy (1).", "As regards the herring stock of the North Sea and of the eastern English Channel,  transfers of up to 50 % of the quotas may be effected from ICES divisions IV c and VII d to ICES  division IV b.\nAs regards the hake stock in zones II a (EC zone) and IV (EC zone), Member States having a quota in  this zone may, on exhaustion of this quota, make transfers from zones V b (EC zone), VI, VII, XII  and XIV and from zones VIII a, b and d to zone II a (EC zone) and IV (EC zone).\nHowever, such transfers must be notified in advance to the Commission.", "1.
