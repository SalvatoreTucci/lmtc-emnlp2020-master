That standard refers to standard EN ISO 12863:2010 \u2018Standard test method for assessing the ignition propensity of cigarettes\u2019. Therefore, reference should also be made to the EN ISO standard when publishing the reference to EN 16156:2010.\n(7) EN ISO 12863:2010 was amended by a technical corrigendum\u00a0(3). The corrigendum was endorsed by CEN without any modification\u00a0(4) and thus included in standard EN 16156:2010.\n(8) Standards EN 16156:2010 and EN ISO 12863:2010 fulfil Mandate M/425 and comply with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC. Their references should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(9) In order to ensure a successful introduction of the standards, industry should be given sufficient time to adapt their production to the safety level provided for in the standards. The publication of the references of the standards in the Official Journal of the European Union 12 months after the standards were made available on 17 November 2010 by CEN is intended to ensure that thereafter in all Member States the presumption of fire safety would be based on common criteria. In order to ensure clarity and legal certainty on the internal market, market surveillance authorities in all Member States should take into account the European standards mentioned in recital 8 when assessing the fire safety of cigarettes, including at the stage of cigarette sales to consumers.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up under Directive 2001/95/EC,", "main_body": ["Standard EN 16156:2010 \u2018Cigarettes \u2014 Assessment of the ignition propensity \u2014 Safety requirement\u2019 and standard EN ISO 12863:2010 \u2018Standard test method for assessing the ignition propensity of cigarettes\u2019 meet the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC for the risk they cover.", "The references of standards EN 16156:2010 and EN ISO 12863:2010 shall be published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union on 17 November 2011.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 August 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 11, 15.1.2002, p. 4.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Technical corrigendum 1.
