Under that Regulation the meat-and-bone meal and related products containing material from animals suspected or confirmed of having contracted BSE, or from animals killed under a BSE eradication measure are to be disposed of as waste by incineration or co-incineration in an approved incineration or co-incineration plant.\n(5) Portugal has insufficient capacity to incinerate or co-incinerate the meat-and-bone meal and related products originating from animals suspected or confirmed of having contracted BSE, or from animals killed under a BSE eradication measure. The accumulation of stocks of that material could pose a risk for public and animal health.\n(6) It is necessary to amend the conditions provided for in Decision 2001/376/EC for the dispatch of the meat-and-bone meal and related products from Portugal. That Decision should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 2001/376/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 September 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.
