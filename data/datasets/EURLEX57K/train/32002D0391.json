In accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the single programming document includes the following elements:\n(a) the strategy and priorities selected for the joint action of the Structural Funds and the Member State; their specific quantified targets; the ex ante evaluation of the expected impact, particularly on the environment, and the consistency of the priorities with the economic, social and regional policies and the employment strategy of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nthe priorities are as follows:\n1. diversifying the economic structure;\n2. strengthening the services sector;\n3. environmental protection, land redevelopment;\n4. urban areas in difficulty;\n5. technical assistance;\n(b) a summary description of the measures planned to implement the priorities, including the information needed to check compliance with the State aid rules under Article 87 of the Treaty;\n(c) the indicative financing plan specifying for each priority and each year the maximum financial allocation envisaged for the contribution from each Fund - including, for information, the total amount from the EAGGF Guarantee Section and the total amounts of eligible public or equivalent expenditure and estimated private funding in the Member State.

The total assistance from the Structural Funds granted under the single programming document amounts to EUR 113034000 for the ERDF. The procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the ERDF for the various priorities included in the single programming document, is set out in the financing plan annexed to this Decision.\n2. During implementation of the financing plan, the total cost or Community financing of a given priority may be adjusted in agreement with the Member State by up to 25 % of the total contribution from the Fund to the single programming document throughout the programme period, up to a maximum of EUR 30 million, without altering the total Community contribution referred to in paragraph 1.", "This Decision is without prejudice to the Commission's position on aid schemes falling within Article 87(1) of the Treaty that are included in this assistance but which it has not yet approved. Submission of the application for assistance, the programme complement or a request for payment by the Member State does not replace the notification required by Article 88(3) of the Treaty.\nCommunity financing of State aid falling within Article 87(1) of the Treaty, granted under aid schemes or in individual cases, requires prior approval by the Commission under Article 88(3) of the Treaty, except where the aid falls under the de minimis rule or is exempted under an exemption regulation adopted by the Commission under Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 (now Articles 87 and 88) to certain categories of horizontal State aid(3).
