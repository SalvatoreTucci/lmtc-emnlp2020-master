In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified.\n(2) Precise definitions are required in order to carry out the surveys provided for in Directive 93/25/EEC. This first requires the definition of the agricultural holdings covered by the survey. The individual categories into which the survey results are to be broken down should also be precisely defined, and the herd size classes and regions according to which the Member States draw up the survey results at regular intervals should be determined. A single definition of carcass weight is necessary for the drawing-up of slaughtering statistics.\n(3) According to Directive 93/25/EEC, the Member States may, at their request, be authorised to use administrative sources instead of statistical surveys on sheep and goat stocks and the prescribed breakdown by herd size classes for the final results of even-numbered years.\n(4) Applications have been made by the Member States for the various types of authorisation.\n(5) This Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics,", "main_body": ["1.
