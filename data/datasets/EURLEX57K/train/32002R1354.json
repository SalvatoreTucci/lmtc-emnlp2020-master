and\n(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.\n(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.\n(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.\n(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1166/2002(4), the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(6), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(8), laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.\n(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.\n(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["The export refunds referred to in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on products exported in the natural state shall be as set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 26 July 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 July 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 48.\n(2) OJ L 79, 22.3.2002, p. 15.\n(3) OJ L 20, 27.1.1999, p. 8.\n(4) OJ L 170, 29.6.2002, p. 51.\n(5) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 104, 20.4.2002, p. 26.\n(7) OJ L 91, 1.4.1984, p. 71.\n(8) OJ L 28, 1.2.1988, p. 1.\nANNEX\nto the Commission Regulation of 25 July 2002 fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products\n>TABLE>\nNB:\nThe product codes and the \"A\" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1), as amended.\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2020/2001 (OJ L 273, 16.10.2001, p. 6).\nThe other destinations are defined as follows:\nL03 Ceuta, Melilla, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Gibraltar, Holy See (often referred to as Vatican City), Malta, Turkey, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Australia and New Zealand,\nL04 Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\nL05 all destinations except Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and the United States of America.\nL06 all destinations except Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and the United States of America.\n970 includes the exports referred to in Articles 36(1)(a) and (c) and 44(1)(a) and (b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 (OJ L 102, 17.4.1999, p. 11) and exports under contracts with armed forces stationed on the territory of a Member State which do not come under its flag."}
