Member States are however encouraged to transmit it as soon as possible.\n(7) For reasons of efficiency and accessibility, a web-based network should be an essential element of the information mechanism concerning national measures in the areas of asylum and immigration.\n(8) The exchange of information on national measures through a web-based network should be complemented by the possibility of exchanging views on such measures.\n(9) The information mechanism established by this Decision should be without prejudice to the right of Member States to request ad-hoc discussions in the Council on national measures at any time, in accordance with the Council's rules of procedure.\n(10) Since the objectives of this Decision, namely secure information exchange and consultation between Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the effects of this Decision, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiary as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(11) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n(12) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Decision and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision establishes a mechanism for the mutual exchange of information concerning national measures in the areas of asylum and immigration that are likely to have a significant impact on several Member States or on the European Union as a whole.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mechanism referred to in paragraph 1 allows for the preparation of exchanges of views and debates on such measures.", "Information to be submitted\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall communicate to the Commission and the other Member States information on the measures which they intend to take, or have recently taken, in the areas of asylum and immigration, where these measures are publicly available and are likely to have a significant impact on several Member States or on the European Union as a whole.\nSuch information shall be transmitted as soon as possible and at the latest when it becomes publicly available.
