In assessing the extent of the overrun in Spain, Greece and Portugal, account should be taken of the estimates for the production of table olives processed into olive oil, expressed as olive-oil equivalent using the relevant coefficients referred to in Commission Decisions 98/605/EC(5), 98/619/EC(6) and 98/620/EC(7).\n(2) Article 17a of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that in order to determine the unit amount of the production aid for olive oil that can be paid in advance, the estimated production for the marketing year concerned should be determined. That amount must be fixed at a level that avoids any risk of unwarranted payment to olive growers. The amount also applies to table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent.\n(3) In order to establish the estimated production, Member States must forward to the Commission data for the olive oil and, where appropriate, table olive production estimates for each marketing year. The Commission may use other sources of information. On the basis of that data, the estimated production of olive oil and table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent, should be fixed for each Member State at the levels indicated below.\n(4) In determining the amount of the advance, account must be taken of the amount withheld for measures to improve the quality of olive oil provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1414/97(8).\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["1.
