In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified.\n(2) Fodder plant seed should not normally be placed on the market unless its packages are labelled with an official label in accordance with the provisions laid down in Directive 66/401/EEC.\n(3) However, the indelible printing of the required information on the package itself, on the basis of the model laid down for the label, may be authorised.\n(4) In respect of cereal seed, Commission Decision 80/755/EEC of 17 July 1980 authorising the indelible printing of prescribed information on packages of cereal seed(5), as amended by Decision 81/109/EEC(6), authorised the indelible printing of the prescribed information on the package itself, on the basis of the model laid down for the label, under certain conditions which ensured that responsibility rested with the certification authority. Since that system has proved to be useful, a similar authorisation should be granted, under the same conditions, in respect of fodder plants.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agricultural, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["1.
