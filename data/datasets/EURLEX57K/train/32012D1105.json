They should therefore continue to be considered to be equivalent.\n(3) As Decision 2003/17/EC will expire on 31 December 2012, the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision should be extended. It appears desirable to extend that period by 10 years.\n(4) The reference to Yugoslavia in Decision 2003/17/EC should be deleted. Serbia, as a member of the OECD Schemes for the Varietal Certification of Seed Moving in International Trade and as a member of the International Seed Testing Association as regards the seed sampling and testing, should be added to the list of third countries in Annex I to Decision 2003/17/EC. In addition, the names of some authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production, as listed in Annex I to Decision 2003/17/EC, have changed.\n(5) The provisions of Decision 2003/17/EC which refer to Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(4) should be deleted as, in the context of this Decision, their application would be incompatible with the system on delegated and implementing powers introduced by Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty.\n(6) Decision 2003/17/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/17/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) Article 4 is deleted;\n(2) Article 5 is deleted;\n(3) in Article 6, the date \u201831 December 2012\u2019 is replaced by the date \u201831 December 2022\u2019;\n(4) Annex I is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 21 November 2012.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
