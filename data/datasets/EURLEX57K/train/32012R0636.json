Otherwise the positive effects they have yielded until now could be nullified. Since the relevant fisheries are indeed still ongoing, the lapse of the emergency measures would re-introduce the catch composition requirements, entailing increased discarding and thus considerable increase in fishing pressure on haddock and other stocks as fishermen seek to legitimately land their quotas.\n(4) Measures on permanent protection of the haddock stocks concerned by Commission Regulation (EU) No 161/2012 might not be in place before the expiry date of application of that Regulation. Meanwhile, the threats for the conservation of the haddock stocks persist.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to extend for six months the emergency measures provided for in Regulation (EU) No 161/2012,", "main_body": ["The application of Regulation (EU) No 161/2012 shall be extended until 25 February 2013.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 52, 24.2.2012, p. 6."}
