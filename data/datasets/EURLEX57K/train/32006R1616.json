The SAA is in the process of ratification.\n(2) On 12 June 2006 the Council concluded an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part\u00a0(1), (hereinafter referred to as the Interim Agreement) which provides for the early entry into force of the trade and trade-related provisions of the SAA. The Interim Agreement will enter into force the first day of the second month following the date of deposit of the last instrument of ratification or approval.\n(3) It is necessary to lay down the procedures for applying certain provisions of both the SAA and the Interim Agreement. Since the trade and trade-related provisions of these instruments are to a very large extent identical, this Regulation should also apply to the implementation of the SAA after its entry into force.\n(4) The SAA and the Interim Agreement stipulate that fishery products originating in Albania may be imported into the Community at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of these tariff quotas.\n(5) Where trade defence measures become necessary, they should be adopted in accordance with the general provisions laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 of 22 December 1994 on the common rules for imports\u00a0(2), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69 of 20 December 1969 establishing

case may be, Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community\u00a0(5).\n(6) Where a Member State provides information to the Commission on a possible fraud or failure to provide administrative cooperation, the relevant Community legislation shall apply, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters\u00a0(6).\n(7) For the purposes of implementing the relevant provisions of this Regulation the Commission should be assisted by the Customs Code Committee
