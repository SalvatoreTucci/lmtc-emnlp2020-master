That application was accompanied by the relevant data supporting the request for the change.\n(3) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 7 July 2009 that there is sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of the enzyme preparation 3-phytase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 101.672) in pigs for fattening at the lower minimum content of 100 FTU per kilogram of complete feedingstuff\u00a0(3).\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 243/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 243/2007, in the seventh column, minimum content, the words \u2018280 FTU\u2019 are replaced by \u2018100 FTU\u00a0(4)\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 December 2009.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 73, 13.3.2007, p. 4.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 1184, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a01 FTU is the amount of enzyme which liberates 1 micromole of inorganic phosphate per minute from sodium phytate at pH 5,5 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C."}
