In order to take account of this Memorandum of Understanding the Commission subsequently adopted Regulation (EC) No 1084/2005.\n(2) It is necessary to clarify the destination of shipments to the Community indicated in footnote 3 of the table shown under (b) in Annex V of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93, as well as a specific conversion rate for children\u2019s garments for textiles category 4.\n(3) It is necessary to provide for arrangements for the treatment of goods sent out from the Community to China for Processing Traffic (OPT).\n(4) These arrangements on OPT should be reflected in Annex VII of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93.\n(5) The quantitative limits laid down in the Memorandum of Understanding have been reached for several product categories. As a consequence, a considerable amount of goods are blocked at the Community ports which creates unexpected difficulties for the normal conduct of trade.\n(6) On 5 September 2005, the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce concluded consultations on how to deal with the problems caused by exports of textile and clothing from China in excess of the quantities established in the Memorandum of Understanding. As a result it was agreed to provide for additional quantities for the categories concerned and to introduce certain flexibilities.\n(7) In order to take into account of the arrangement agreed by the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce it is necessary to adjust the quantitative limits for imports of textile and clothing products originating in China for 2005 and 2006 and to provide for certain flexibilities. Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) In addition, given the particular circumstances of this situation, it is appropriate to provide for additional quantities in order to allow for the release of all textile and clothing products which are currently blocked.\n(9) In view of the urgency of the matter, the Regulation should enter into force without delay.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textile Committee set up by Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 is amended as follows:\n1.

Import authorisations for such products shall be granted automatically and without quantitative limits by the competent authorities of the Member States, upon adequate proof, such as the bill of lading, and the presentation of a signed declaration by the importer, that the goods have been shipped to the Community before that date. By way of derogation of Article 2(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93, imports of goods shipped before 11 June 2005 shall also be released for free circulation upon the presentation of a surveillance document issued in accordance with Article 10a(2a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93.\nImport authorisations for goods shipped to the Community between 11 June 2005 and 12 July shall be granted automatically and cannot be denied on the grounds that there are no quantities available within the 2005 quantitative limits. However, the import of all products shipped from 11 June 2005 will be counted against the 2005 quantitative limits.\nThe granting of import authorisations will not require the presentation of the corresponding export licenses for goods shipped to the Community before China has put in place its export licensing system (20 July 2005).\nApplications for import licences for the import, from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, of goods that have been shipped between 11 June 2005 and 19 July 2005 (inclusive) shall be presented to the competent authorities of a Member State no later than 20 September 2005.\nGoods shipped before 12 July do not need to have been shipped directly to the Community to benefit from the exemption of quantitative limits, although the competent authorities of the Community may deny such benefits if they have reasons to suspect that they have been shipped to another destination before 12 July in order to circumvent this Regulation, in case such transactions do not respond to normal business practices or purely logistical reasons. By way of example, are considered as corresponding to a normal conduct of business goods shipped to distribution centres for the importing companies, or when the importer can present a contract or letter of credit preceding the date of shipment, or when the goods have been transhipped outside China onto another means of transport within a reasonably short period of time.\nThe increases to the agreed levels introduced by the Regulation (EC) No 1478/2005 are made available to enable the issuance of import licences for goods shipped to the Community between 13 and 19 July 2005, or for goods shipped to the Community after 20 July 2005 with a valid Chinese export licence, which are in excess of the agreed levels introduced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1084/2005 in Annex V to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93.\nShould any goods shipped to the Community between 13 and 19 July 2005 exceed these levels, the Commission may authorise the issuance of further import licences after informing the Textiles Committee, and after effecting the transfer of 2\u00a0072\u00a0924 kg of products of category 2 as provided for in Annex VIII.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0See Appendix A.\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn Annex VII to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 the table is replaced by the following:\n\u2018TABLE\nCOMMUNITY QUANTITATIVE LIMITS FOR GOODS RE-IMPORTED UNDER OPT\nThird country Category Unit Community quantitative limits\n2005\nBelarus GROUP IB\n4 1\u00a0000 pieces 4\u00a0733\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces 6\u00a0599\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces 8\u00a0800\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces 6\u00a0605\n8 1\u00a0000 pieces 2\u00a0249\nGROUP IIB\n12 1\u00a0000 pairs 4\u00a0446\n13 1\u00a0000 pieces 697\n15 1\u00a0000 pieces 3\u00a0858\n16 1\u00a0000 pieces 786\n21 1\u00a0000 pieces 2\u00a0567\n24 1\u00a0000 pieces 661\n26/27 1\u00a0000 pieces 3\u00a0215\n29 1\u00a0000 pieces 1\u00a0304\n73 1\u00a0000 pieces 4\u00a0998\n83 tonnes 664\nGROUP IIIB\n74 1\u00a0000 pieces 872\nSerbia\u00a0(1) GROUP IB\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces\n8 1\u00a0000 pieces\nGROUP IIB\n15 1\u00a0000 pieces\n16 1\u00a0000 pieces\nVietnam\u00a0(2) GROUP IB\n4 1\u00a0000 pieces\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces\n8 1\u00a0000 pieces\nGROUP IIB\n12 1\u00a0000 pairs\n13 1\u00a0000 pieces\n15 1\u00a0000 pieces\n18 tonnes\n21 1\u00a0000 pieces\n26 1\u00a0000 pieces\n31 1\u00a0000 pieces\n68 tonnes\n76 tonnes\n78 tonnes\nThird country Category Unit Specific agreed levels\n11 June to 31 December 2005\u00a0(3) 2006 2007\nChina GROUP IB\n4 1\u00a0000 pieces 208 408 449\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces 453 886 975\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces 1\u00a0642 3\u00a0216 3\u00a0538\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces 439 860 946\nGROUP IIB\n26 1\u00a0000 pieces 791 1\u00a0550 1\u00a0705\n31 1\u00a0000 pieces 6\u00a0301 12\u00a0341 13\u00a0575\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative restrictions for Serbia do not apply pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and Serbia on trade in textile products (OJ L 90, 8.4.2005, p. 36).
