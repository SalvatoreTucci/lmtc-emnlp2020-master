By letter dated 19 September 2012, the Commission notified Slovenia that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n(3) Under Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC, certain Member States which acceded to the Union after 1 January 1978 may exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of the amounts at the conversion rate on the day of their accession as specified in that provision. Slovenia has requested that its corresponding threshold, which is established at EUR 25\u00a0000 pursuant to point 15 of Article 287, be increased to EUR 50\u00a0000.\n(4) A higher threshold for the special scheme for small enterprises is a simplification measure, as it may significantly reduce the VAT obligations of small businesses. The special scheme is optional for taxable persons.\n(5) In its proposal of 29 October 2004 for a Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC, now Directive 2006/112/EC, with a view to simplifying valued added tax obligations, the Commission included provisions aimed at allowing Member States to set the annual turnover ceiling for the VAT exemption scheme at up to EUR 100\u00a0000 or the equivalent in national currency, with the possibility of updating that amount each year. The request submitted by Slovenia is in line with that proposal.\n(6) The derogating measure will have only a negligible effect on the overall amount of the tax revenue of Slovenia collected at the stage of final consumption and will have no adverse impact on the Union\u2019s own resources accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from point 15 of Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Republic of Slovenia is authorised to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 50\u00a0000.", "This Decision shall take effect on the day of its notification.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013 until the date of entry into force of a Directive amending the amounts of the annual turnover ceilings below which taxable persons may qualify for VAT exemption or until 31 December 2015, whichever date is earlier.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Slovenia."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 January 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
