That Decision sets out the tasks and procedures to be adopted by each national football information point.\n(3) Decision 2002/348/JHA should be revised and updated in the light of experience in recent years, such as the European Championships in 2004 and the experts' assessment of international police cooperation in the framework of that championship and extensive police cooperation in respect of international and club matches in Europe generally. In recent years, the number of supporters travelling to matches abroad continues to grow. Therefore, it is necessary for the competent bodies to strengthen their cooperation and to put the exchange of information on a professional footing in order to prevent disturbances to law and order and to allow every Member State to make an efficient risk assessment. The proposed amendments are the results of gathered experiences from several national football information points in their daily work and should enable them to work in a more structured and professional way, ensuring the exchange of high quality information.\n(4) The amendments are without prejudice to existing national provisions, in particular the divisions of responsibilities among the different authorities and services in the Member States concerned, and to the exercise by the Commission of its powers under the Treaty establishing the European Community,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/348/JHA is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
