The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. This tolerance was defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases\u00a0(2).\n(2) The Government of Hungary has requested the Commission to authorise four methods for grading pig carcases and has submitted the results of its dissection trials which were executed before the day of accession, by presenting part two of the protocol provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85.\n(3) The evaluation of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorising these grading methods are fulfilled.\n(4) Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 lays down that Member States may be authorised to provide for a presentation of pig carcases different from the standard presentation defined in the same Article where commercial practice or technical requirements warrant such a derogation.\n(5) In Hungary the traditions in carcase presentation and, consequently, commercial practice, necessitate that carcases can be presented with flare fat and diaphragm. This should be taken into account in adjusting the weight recorded to the weight for standard presentation.\n(6) No modification of the apparata or grading methods may be authorised except by means of a new Commission Decision adopted in the light of experience gained. For this reason, the present authorisation may be revoked.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["The use of the following methods is hereby authorised for grading pig carcases pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 in Hungary:\n(a) the apparatus termed Fat-O-Meater FOM S70 and Fat-O-Meater FOM S71 and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of the Annex;\n(b) the apparatus termed Uni-Fat-O-Meater FOM S89 (UNIFOM) and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 2 of the Annex;\n(c) the apparatus termed Ultra FOM 200 and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 3 of the Annex;\n(d) the apparatus termed Fully automatic ultrasonic carcase grading (AUTOFOM) and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 4 of the Annex.\nAs regards the apparatus \u2018Ultra FOM 200\u2019, referred to in point (c) of the first paragraph, it is laid down that after the end of the measurement procedure it must be possible to verify on the carcase that the apparatus measured the values of measurement SZ1 and SZ2 on the site provided for in Part 3(3) of the Annex. The corresponding marking of the measurement site must be made at the same time as the measurement procedure.", "Notwithstanding the standard presentation referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84, the flare fat and the diaphragm need not be removed from pig carcases before being weighed and graded.

Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed as Fat-O-Meater FOM S70 and Fat-O-Meater FOM S71.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 6 millimetres (mm) diameter containing an optical sonde of the Fremstillet AF Radiometer Copenhagen/Slagteriernes Forskningsinstitut Optisk Sonde MQ type and having an operating distance of between 5 and 105 mm. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer type S70 and S71 respectively.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated lean meat content (in percentage)\nSZ1 = back fat thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P1 (at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae)\nSZ2 = back fat thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P2 (at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs)\nH2 = muscle thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P2 (at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs)\nW = warm weight of the carcase (kg).\nPart 2\nUNI-FAT-O-MEATER FOM S89 (UNIFOM)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed Uni-Fat-O-Meater FOM S89 (UNIFOM).\n2. The apparatus is the same as the apparatus described under point 2 of Part 1. However, Unifom differs from FOM with regard to computer and software for the interpretation of the reflection profile from the optical probe. Furthermore, Unifom is not connected with the weighing instrument.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= estimated lean meat content (in percentage)\nSZ1 = back fat thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P1 (at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae)\nSZ2 = back fat thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P2 (at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs)\nH2 = muscle thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P2 (at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs).\nPart 3\nULTRA FOM 200\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018Ultra FOM 200\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with an ultrasonic probe at 4 MHz (Krautkr\u00e4mer MB 4 SE). The ultrasonic signal is digitised, stored and processed by a micro-processor (type Intel 80 C 32). The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the Ultra-FOM apparatus itself.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= estimated lean meat content (in percentage)\nSZ1 = back fat thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P1 (at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae)\nSZ2 = back fat thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P2 (at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs)\nH2 = muscle thickness measured in millimetres at measuring point P2 (at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs)\nW = warm weight of the carcase (kg).\nPart 4\nFULLY AUTOMATIC ULTRASONIC CARCASE GRADING (AUTOFOM)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed AUTOFOM (Fully automatic ultrasonic carcase grading).\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with 16 ultrasonic transducers, 2 MHz (Krautkr\u00e4mer, SFK 2 NP), with an operating distance between each transducers of 25 mm.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated on the basis of 60 measurement points using the following formula:\n= the estimated lean meat percentage,\n4. Descriptions of the measurement points and the statistical method can be found in Part II of the Hungarian protocol forwarded to the Commission in accordance with Article 3(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85."}
