Irrespective of the accounting rules applied in Member States, expenditure to be recorded for any one year shall be expenditure incurred during that year on the construction, running and administration of infrastructure. Amortisation of, and interest on, loans contracted for the purpose of financing infrastructure expenditure shall not be included.", "Infrastructure expenditure accounts shall be kept for all railways, roads and inland waterways open to public traffic, with the following exceptions:    (a) railways not connected to the principal networks of the several Member States;\n(b) roads closed to motor traffic, that is to vehicles with a cylinder capacity equal to or exceeding 50 cubic cm;\n(c) roads used exclusively by agricultural or forestry vehicles or which serve only to provide access for agricultural of forestry operations;\n(d) inland waterways on which traffic is limited to vessels of less than 250 metric tons deadweight;\n(e) waterways of a maritime character, a list of which shall be drawn up by the Commission pursuant to Article 9.

Until such time as common criteria for determining the proportion attributable to the  transport function of expenditure common to that function and to other functions of infrastructure expenditure have been laid down by the Commission in pursuance of Article 9 (1) and applied by the Member States, expenditure relating specifically to the transport function and total common expenditure shall be recorded separately under the various headings shown in the forms of accounts.\n2. Until, in pursuance of Article 9 (1), agreement has been reached on the criteria to be applied in drawing the dividing line between roads situated within built-up areas and those situated outside such areas, Member States shall, when compiling the figures referred to in Article 5 (2) (b) and in Annex III B, use criteria of their own choice, details of which shall be included in the information which they send to the Commission pursuant to Articles 5 and 7.\n3. For the Federal Republic of Germany, communication to the Commission of the information provided for in Annex II C shall be compulsory only with effect from the return for the year 1972.\n4.

The Commission shall be responsible for the overall co-ordination of the various measures arising out of this Regulation and for seeing that its provisions are applied in a uniform manner. In particular the Commission shall specify the contents of the various headings in the forms of accounts shown in Annex I and lay down common criteria for determining the proportion attributable to the transport function of expenditure common to that function and to other functions of infrastructure.\nThe Commission shall also endeavour to bring about a progressive alignment of the detailed accounting procedures followed in Member States, the approximation of the criteria applied in drawing the dividing line between roads situated within built-up areas and those situated outside such areas, and the improvement and approximation of methods for compiling returns on the use of infrastructure.\n2.
