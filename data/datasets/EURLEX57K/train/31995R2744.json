whereas the statistics of the structure of earnings must consequently be carried out on the basis of common definitions and harmonized methodologies;\nWhereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the creation of common statistical standards enabling harmonized information to be produced is action which can be effectively undertaken only at Community level; whereas these standards will be implemented in each Member State on the authority of the agencies and institutions appointed to compile official statistics;\nWhereas, pursuant to Decision 93/464/EEC\u00a0(5), the production of Community statistics on the structure of earnings is one of the priority actions in the Statistical Programme 1993 to 1997;\nWhereas it seems appropriate to make provisions for exceptions for certain Member States, in order to take account of particular technical difficulties encountered by such States in the collection of certain types of information, provided that the quality of the statistical information is not affected;\nWhereas the Statistical Programme Committee established by Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(6), has reached a favourable conclusion on the Commission proposal,", "main_body": ["General provisions\nThe Member States and the Commission, within their respective fields of competences, shall produce Community statistics on the structure and distribution of all employees' earnings in the sections of economic activities defined in Article 3.", "Reference period\nThe statistics shall be produced on the basis of statistical information for the financial year of 1995 and for a corresponding representative month, subject to the special provisions mentioned in the Annex.", "Scope\nThe statistics shall cover all activities defined in sections C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and K of the Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, hereinafter referred to as \u2018NACE Rev. 1\u2019 established by Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90\u00a0(7), subject to the special provisions mentioned in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Statistical Units\nCollection of data and compilation of statistics on the structure and distribution of earnings shall be based on any of the statistical units defined in Regulation (EEC) No 696/93\u00a0(8) and shall provide information for employees in local units of 10 and more employees classified by size and principal activity.", "Characteristics of the required information\nData shall be collected on:\n1. the local unit to which the sampled employees are attached, as follows:\n2. each employee in the sample, as follows:\n(a) gross earnings for a complete pay period for the representative month, including the various bonuses regularly paid, additional payments for overtime, shift work, night work, weekend work and commissions;
