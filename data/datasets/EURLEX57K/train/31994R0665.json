whereas the former German Democratic Republic had concluded long-term cooperation and investment agreements with Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR which will give rise to reciprocal deliveries of goods at zero rates of  duty for many years to come;\nWhereas agreements of the first type have not been renewed after 31 December 1990 and agreements of the second type will be re-negotiated at Community, German or private enterprise level, but whereas this process of re-negotiation will take some time;\nWhereas the maximum quantities or values mentioned in these agreements do not entail legally binding obligations between the parties; whereas non-enforcement thereof cannot therefore give rise to any compensation by the Community;\nWhereas it is necessary, therefore, during a transitional period to attenuate the impact resulting from German unification on both types of agreement as otherwise serious repercussions on enterprises in the territory of the former German Democratic  Republic and in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine,  Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could result and, indeed, the stability of the economies of these countries might be adversely affected thereby;\nWhereas for these reasons it is appropriate to suspend temporarily the duties of the Common Customs Tariff for products originating in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia,  Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which are covered by the abovementioned agreements  between the former German Democratic Republic and these countries, up to the maximum quantities or values laid down therein;\nWhereas it is appropriate, in view of the special circumstances of German unification, for the said suspension of duties to be applicable to the products concerned only in so far as they are put into free circulation in the territory of the former  German Democratic Republic;\nWhereas it is necessary to make provision for determining the origin of the goods which will be covered by the said suspension of duties;\nWhereas, in view of the difficulties in applying these measures and the fact that some of their consequences are unforeseeable, it is appropriate to emphasize the transitional character of these measures and restrict their duration to a one-year period  up to 31 December 1994;\nWhereas a similar transitional arrangement was set up until 31 December 1992 by Regulation (EEC) No 3568/90 (1) and by Decision No 3788/90/ECSC (2) extended until 31 December 1993 by Regulation (EEC) No 1343/93 (3) and by Decision No 1535/93/ECSC (4);  whereas in the light of experience since 1990 it seems suitable to exclude products of Annex II to the Treaty from the benefit of the present arrangements;\nWhereas it is appropriate to provide for special measures and a procedure to put them in place, in case the temporary suspension of duties causes or threatens to cause serious injury to a branch of Community industry;\nWhereas these measures must be solely related to the customs tariff and, in any event, must not prejudice the application of Community measures under the common commercial policy,", "main_body": ["1.
