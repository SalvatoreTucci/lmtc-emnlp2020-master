It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01043/2005 and in Article 1(1) and in point (1) of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0318/2006, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0318/2006, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 June 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 5.7.2005, p. 24.
