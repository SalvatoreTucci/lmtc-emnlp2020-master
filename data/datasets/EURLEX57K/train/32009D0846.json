The Commission is responsible for the management of the programmes.\n(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, concerning governance of the security aspects of the European satellite radio navigation programmes, lays down in particular that the Commission is to manage all the security aspects of the systems resulting from these programmes.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 16 of that Regulation, where programme security is concerned the European GNSS Supervisory Authority is responsible for security accreditation and the operation of the Galileo Security Centre on the basis of guidelines adopted by the Commission.\n(4) The tasks assigned to the Commission and the European GNSS Supervisory Authority respectively pursuant to the abovementioned provisions in the context of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes entail the exchange of classified information between those two entities. They also entail the exchange of classified information between the European GNSS Supervisory Authority on the one hand and the European Space Agency, Council and Member States on the other, via the Commission.\n(5) In Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom\u00a0(3), the Commission amended its internal Rules of Procedure to include rules setting out basic principles and minimum standards of security, particularly with regard to EU classified information.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004, the European GNSS Supervisory Authority has the task of applying the security principles contained in Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom. This covers, inter alia, provisions for the exchange, handling and storage of classified information.\n(7) At present there is no framework for the exchange of classified information between the Commission and the European GNSS Supervisory Authority or between the European GNSS Supervisory Authority on the one hand and the European Space Agency, Council and Member States on the other, via the Commission.\n(8) It is therefore necessary to conclude an Agreement between the Commission and the European GNSS Supervisory Authority on the security and exchange of classified information. Such an Agreement has been negotiated by the Commission and the European GNSS Supervisory Authority and should therefore be approved and signed,", "main_body": ["The Agreement between the European Commission and the European GNSS Supervisory Authority on the security and exchange of classified information is hereby approved.\nThe text of the Agreement is annexed to this Decision.", "The Director-General of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport of the European Commission is hereby authorised to sign the Agreement on behalf of the Commission.", "This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 October 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAntonio TAJANI\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0196, 24.7.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0246, 20.7.2004, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0317, 3.12.2001, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nAgreement between the European Commission and the European GNSS Supervisory Authority on the security and exchange of classified information\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nhereinafter \u2018the Commission\u2019, represented by the Director-General for Energy and Transport,\nof the one part, and\nTHE EUROPEAN GNSS SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY,\nhereinafter \u2018the GSA\u2019, represented by its Executive Director,\nof the other part,\nhereinafter \u2018the parties\u2019 or \u2018the party\u2019,\nHAVING REGARD to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHAVING REGARD to Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the further implementation of the European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo),\nHAVING REGARD to Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 of 12 July 2004 on the establishment of structures for the management of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes,\nHAVING REGARD to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 29 November 2001, amending its internal rules of procedure,\nWHEREAS there is a permanent need, in the context of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes EGNOS and Galileo, to exchange classified information between the parties,\nNOTING THAT to ensure optimum and effective cooperation and consultations it may be necessary to have access to classified information of the parties, and to exchange classified information between the parties,\nMINDFUL of the fact that such access and such an exchange of classified information call for appropriate security measures,\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n(a) \u2018classified information\u2019 means any information (namely, knowledge that can be communicated in any form) or any material, including documents, considered by one of the parties to require protection against unauthorised disclosure and designated as such by a security classification;\n(b) \u2018party from which the information originates\u2019 means the party from which classified information that is communicated or disclosed to the other party, namely the receiving party, originates;\n(c) \u2018receiving party\u2019 means the party which receives classified information from the other party, namely the party from which the information originates;\n(d) \u2018security regulations\u2019 means Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom, to the extent that it is applicable to each party, and the internal procedures and regulations of each party.\nArticle 2\nThis Agreement shall apply to classified information communicated by one party to the other party or exchanged between them in accordance with their respective security regulations for the purposes of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes (Galileo and EGNOS).\nArticle 3\nEach party:\n(a) shall ensure the protection and safeguarding of classified information covered by this Agreement which is communicated by one party to the other party or exchanged between them;\n(b) shall ensure that the classified information communicated or exchanged under this Agreement keeps the security classification allocated to it by the party from which the information originates.
