The Greek authorities submitted to the Commission a request for the extension of the deadline fixed by Article 3(3) of Commission Regulation (EU) No\u00a0807/2010 of 14 September 2010 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Union\u00a0(5), and of the deadline fixed by Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0945/2010. Portugal presented a similar request relating to the deadline for payment operations fixed by Article 3(3) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0807/2010. In view of the difficult financial situation faced by these Member States, it is appropriate to allow them to complete payment operations for products mobilised on the market and to allow the withdrawal of the remaining quantities of intervention stocks, so that these allocations remain available to increase the quantity of food products distributed to the most deprived people. It is, therefore, necessary to grant an extension of those two deadlines. In order to ensure equal treatment of Member States, the derogations should cover all payment operations for products mobilised on the market and all withdrawals of dairy products from intervention stocks under the 2011 annual plan. As the deadline for the payment operations for products mobilised on the market was set at 1 September and for the withdrawal of dairy products from Union intervention stocks at 30 September, these two derogations should apply retroactively.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No\u00a0945/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1) the following Article 3a is inserted:\n(2) in Article 4, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(3) the following Article 5a is inserted:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", ", points (2) and (3) shall apply from 31 August 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 349, 24.12.1998, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 152, 11.6.2011, p. 24.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 278, 22.10.2010, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 242, 15.9.2010, p. 9."}
