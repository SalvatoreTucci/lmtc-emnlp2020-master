The European Council also referred to the importance of the information to be provided by the ILO's network in developing an evaluation mechanism to monitor relations with third countries which do not cooperate with the European Union in combating illegal immigration.\n(5) Following the Thessaloniki European Council, it is necessary to formalise the existence and functioning of such a network - drawing on experiences gained in the operation of running projects, including the Belgian-led Western Balkans ILO network - through a legally binding act, setting out the obligation to establish forms of cooperation among immigration liaison officers of the Member States, the objectives of such cooperation, the functions and appropriate qualifications of such liaison officers, as well as their responsibilities vis-\u0102\u00a0-vis the host country and the sending Member State.\n(6) It is also desirable to formalise the way in which the relevant institutions of the Community are informed of the activities of the immigration officers liaison network so as to allow them to take or propose such measures as may be necessary to improve further the overall management of the controls on persons at the external borders of the Member States.\n(7) Taking into account Council Decision 2003/170/JHA of 27 February 2003 on the common use of liaison officers posted abroad by the law enforcement agencies of the Member States(2).\n(8) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(3), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, points A and E of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement(4).\n(9) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(10) The United Kingdom is taking part in this Regulation, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(5).\n(11) Ireland is taking part in this Regulation, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 6(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning the request of Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(6).\n(12) The participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland in this Regulation in accordance with Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 and Article 6(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 relates to the responsibilities of the Community for taking measures developing the provisions of the Schengen acquis against the organisation of illegal immigration in which the United Kingdom and Ireland participate.\n(13) This Regulation constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the 2003 Act of Accession,", "main_body": ["1.
