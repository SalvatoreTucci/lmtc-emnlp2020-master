In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92 provided for a Community-wide carcase classification standard with the object of improving market transparency in the sheepmeat sector. Detailed rules are required for the determination of market prices which are established on the basis of this classification standard. Provision should be made for the establishment of market prices at the appropriate point in the commercialisation process. This point should be at entry to the slaughterhouse. In order to ensure the uniform classification of the carcases of ovine animals in the Community, it is necessary to make the definitions of conformation classes, fat classes and colour more precise.\n(3) A system of price reporting should be established on the basis of the classification made at slaughterhouses immediately after slaughtering. This requires proper identification of carcases.\n(4) Classification should be carried out by sufficiently qualified staff. The reliability of classification must be verified by effective checks to ensure that it is applied in a homogenous manner.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92 provides that on-the-spot inspections are to be carried out by a Community inspection group, in order to ensure the uniform application of the Community scale for classification in the Community.\n(6) It is necessary to lay down detailed rules for the composition of the group and implementation of the on-the-spot inspections.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The market price to be established on the basis of the Community scale for the classification of carcases of ovine animals referred to in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92 shall be the price at entry to the slaughterhouse, net of value-added tax paid to the supplier for lamb of Community origin.

Member States shall notify the Commission of the corrective factors used.\nHowever, for the purposes of the categories referred to in Annex III to that Regulation, Member States may report prices per 100 kg for the customary presentation of these carcases.
