The Commission should also be given the possibility of initiating, on the internal market, information measures related to Community regimes concerning the quality and labelling of agricultural products and foodstuffs.\n(5) In the light of experience gained with the implementation of the degressive contribution from 60 to 40\u00a0% in cases of multiannual programmes, the provisions concerning the Community contribution to such programmes should be simplified, while maintaining the level of the Community contribution at 50\u00a0% of the effective cost of each programme.\n(6) The share of the contribution of the Member State(s) and the proposing organisation(s) should be made more flexible, leaving however a minimum share of compulsory financing to be borne by the proposing organisation.\n(7) It is highly important that the materials which are used in information and promotion campaigns are checked as regards their conformity with Community legislation. It is therefore necessary to clarify the existing monitoring obligations of Member States in that respect.\n(8) The contributions of the Member State(s) to programmes are made in the context of a specific procedure. Member States should therefore be exempted from the obligation to notify such national contributions as state aid in order to simplify the administrative proceedings concerned, as these contributions should not be considered as state aid within the meaning of Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaty.\n(9) Ad hoc working groups of representatives from Member States and/or experts with particular expertise in promotion and publicity matters can usefully advise the Commission in developing the strategy and the implementation measures for the regime. The possibility for consulting such groups should therefore be provided for.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999 should continue to apply after 31 December 2004.\n(11) In order to permit the necessary adaptations for implementing the proposed measures, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2005.\n(12) Regulations (EC) No 2702/1999 and (EC) No 2826/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2, point (c) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) information campaigns, in particular on the Community systems covering protected designations of origin (PDOs), protected geographical indications (PGIs), guaranteed traditional specialities (GTSs) and organic production, as well as other Community regimes concerning quality standards and labelling for agricultural products and foodstuffs, and graphic symbols laid down in the relevant Community legislation;\u2019\n2.
