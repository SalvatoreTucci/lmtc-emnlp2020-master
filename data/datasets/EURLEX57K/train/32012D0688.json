According to that Decision, Member States were to take all necessary actions in order to allow the coordinated and progressive introduction of the UMTS services on their territory by 1 January 2002 at the latest and in particular were to establish an authorisation system for UMTS by 1 January 2000 at the latest. This Decision expired on 22 January 2003, but the harmonisation of the spectrum has remained in place.\n(2) The Commission has since then supported a more flexible use of spectrum in its Communication on \u2018Rapid access to spectrum for wireless electronic communications services through more flexibility\u2019\u00a0(3), which inter alia addresses the terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band and aims to avoid disruption of the market. The principles of technological neutrality and service neutrality have been confirmed by Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)\u00a0(4).\n(3) The designation of the paired sub-bands 1\u00a0920-1\u00a0980\u00a0MHz and 2\u00a0110-2\u00a0170\u00a0MHz (\u2018the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band\u2019) for systems capable of providing electronic communications services is an important element addressing the convergence of the mobile, fixed and broadcasting sectors and reflecting technical innovation. Systems deployed in the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band should mainly target end-user access to broadband services.\n(4) Users of wireless broadband services for which the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band is already used today in one Member State can also gain access to equivalent services in any other Member State. However, the unpaired sub-band 1\u00a0900-1\u00a0920\u00a0MHz, although licensed to operators in many Member States, remains largely unused, and the unpaired sub-band 2\u00a0010-2\u00a0025\u00a0MHz is licensed to operators just in few Member States and not used.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 4(2) of Decision No 676/2002/EC, the Commission gave on 15 June 2009 a mandate to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (the \u2018CEPT\u2019) to develop least restrictive technical conditions for frequency bands addressed in the context of the Wireless Access Policy for Electronic Communications Services (WAPECS).\n(6) In response to that mandate, the CEPT has issued a report (CEPT Report 39) containing least restrictive technical conditions and guidance for their application to base stations and terminal stations operating in the terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band. In the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band, these technical conditions are appropriate to manage the risk of harmful interference between neighbouring networks at national and cross-border level without imposing any particular type of technology and based on optimised parameters for the most likely use of the band. In the unpaired sub-bands 1\u00a0900-1\u00a0920\u00a0MHz and 2\u00a0010-2\u00a0025\u00a0MHz (\u2018the unpaired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band\u2019) however, the technical conditions contained in CEPT Report 39 are more restrictive for the operation of mobile networks than stipulated in current existing national rights of use.\n(7) In accordance with CEPT Report 39 the concept of Block Edge Masks (BEM), which are technical parameters that apply to the entire block of spectrum of a specific user, irrespective of the number of channels occupied by the user\u2019s chosen technology, would be appropriate. These masks are intended to form part of the authorisation conditions for spectrum usage. They cover both emissions within the block of spectrum (i.e. in-block power) as well as emissions outside the block (i.e. out-of-block emission). They are regulatory requirements aimed at managing the risk of harmful interference between neighbouring networks and are without prejudice to limits set in equipment standards under Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity\u00a0(5) (R&TTE Directive).\n(8) The technical conditions defined as a result of the mandate to CEPT also aim to protect existing applications in adjacent bands against harmful interference. For that purpose, compliance with the existing spectrum emission mask for UMTS should be ensured below 1\u00a0900\u00a0MHz, between 1\u00a0980 and 2\u00a0010\u00a0MHz, between 2\u00a0025 and 2\u00a0110\u00a0MHz and above 2\u00a0170\u00a0MHz. In so far as coexistence with another radio application is not addressed in CEPT Report 39 and the Electronic Communications Committee\u2019s ERC Report 65, which the CEPT Report 39 uses as a basis, appropriate sharing criteria for coexistence could also be defined based on national considerations.\n(9) The results of CEPT Report 39 should be made applicable in the Union and implemented by the Member States taking into account the existing rights of use in the terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band for UMTS and the effective use of spectrum.\n(10) However, given the restrictive technical conditions on transmission power levels for the unpaired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band set out in CEPT Report 39 \u2014 in order to protect operations in the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band and ensure coexistence of multiple TDD networks \u2014 as well as the limited overall bandwidth of the unpaired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band, the take-up of wireless broadband services under the current license conditions is obstructed. This situation requires studying alternative harmonisation measures for the unpaired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band and may entail modification of existing licences. In order not to prevent the early introduction of flexibility of use in the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band, the separation of harmonisation measures for the paired and unpaired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz bands becomes necessary.\n(11) Technical harmonisation conditions should be introduced only for the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band without prejudice to the right of Member States to organise the authorisation of the use of the terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band taking into consideration the rights of use in existence under their jurisdiction and in line with Union law, and in particular Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)\u00a0(6), and Articles 9 and 9a of Directive 2002/21/EC.\n(12) Harmonisation under this Decision should not exclude the possibility for a Member State to apply, where justified and taking into account existing rights of use, transitional periods that could include radio spectrum sharing arrangements, pursuant to Article 4(5) of Decision No 676/2002/EC.\n(13) In order to ensure effective use of the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band also in the long term, administrations should continue with studies that may increase efficiency and innovative use. Such studies should be taken into account when considering a review of this Decision.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,", "main_body": ["This Decision aims at harmonising the conditions for the availability and efficient use of the frequency bands 1\u00a0920-1\u00a0980\u00a0MHz and 2\u00a0110-2\u00a0170\u00a0MHz (hereafter \u2018the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band\u2019) for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services in the Union.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By 30 June 2014 at the latest, or whenever applying Article 9a of Directive 2002/21/EC at an earlier date to an existing right or issuing new rights to use part or all of the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band, Member States shall designate and make available, on a non-exclusive basis, the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services, in compliance with the parameters set out in the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and pursuant to Article 4(5) of Decision No 676/2002/EC, Member States may request transitional periods that may include radio spectrum sharing arrangements and that shall expire by 24 May 2016 at the latest.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that the systems referred to in paragraph 1 give appropriate protection to systems in adjacent bands.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall facilitate cross-border coordination agreements with the aim of enabling the operation of the systems referred to in paragraph 1, taking into account existing regulatory procedures and rights.", "Member States shall keep the use of the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band under scrutiny and report their findings to the Commission to allow regular and timely review of this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nNeelie KROES\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 17, 22.1.1999, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0COM(2007) 50.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 33.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 7.4.1999, p. 10.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 21.\nANNEX\nPARAMETERS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2(1)\nThe technical conditions presented in this Annex are in the form of frequency arrangements and block-edge masks (BEMs). A BEM is an emission mask that is defined, as a function of frequency, relative to the edge of a block of spectrum for which rights of use are granted to an operator. It consists of in-block and out-of-block components which specify the permitted emission levels over frequencies inside and outside the licensed block of spectrum, respectively.\nThe BEM levels are built up by combining the values listed in the tables below in such a way that the limit at any frequency is given by the highest (least stringent) value of (a) the baseline requirements, (b) the transition requirements, and (c) the in-block requirements (where appropriate). The BEMs are presented as upper limits on the mean equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) or total radiated power (TRP)\u00a0(1) over an averaging time interval, and over a measurement frequency bandwidth. In the time domain, the EIRP or TRP is averaged over the active portions of signal bursts and corresponds to a single power control setting. In the frequency domain, the EIRP or TRP is determined over the measurement bandwidth specified in point B(2), Tables 1, 2 and 3\u00a0(2). In general, and unless stated otherwise, the BEM levels correspond to the aggregate power radiated by the relevant device including all transmit antennas, except in the case of baseline and transition requirements for base stations, which are specified per antenna.\nBEMs shall be applied as an essential component of the technical conditions necessary to ensure coexistence between services at national level. However, it should be understood that the derived BEMs do not always provide the required level of protection of victim services and additional mitigation techniques would need to be applied in a proportionate manner at national level in order to resolve any remaining cases of interference, also with respect to adjacent bands.\nMember States shall also ensure that operators of terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services can use less stringent technical parameters than those set out below in points A, B and C provided that the use of these parameters is agreed among all affected parties and that these operators continue to comply with the technical conditions applicable for the protection of other services, applications or networks and with obligations resulting from cross-border coordination.\nEquipment operating in this band may also make use of power limits other than those set out below provided that appropriate mitigation techniques are applied which comply with Directive 1999/5/EC and which offer at least an equivalent level of protection to that provided by these technical parameters.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General parameters\nWithin the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band, the frequency arrangement shall be as follows:\n(1) The duplex mode of operation shall be Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). The duplex spacing shall be 190\u00a0MHz with terminal station transmission (FDD uplink) located in the lower part of the band starting at 1\u00a0920\u00a0MHz and finishing at 1\u00a0980\u00a0MHz and base station transmission (FDD downlink) located in the upper part of the band starting at 2\u00a0110\u00a0MHz and finishing at 2\u00a0170\u00a0MHz.\n(2) The spectrum block edge nearest to 1\u00a0920\u00a0MHz starts at 1\u00a0920,3\u00a0MHz or above\u00a0(3).\nBase station and terminal station transmission within the paired terrestrial 2\u00a0GHz band shall be in compliance with the BEMs in this Annex.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Technical conditions for FDD base stations\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In-block requirements\nAn in-block EIRP limit for base stations is not obligatory. However, Member States may set an EIRP limit of between 61\u00a0dBm/5\u00a0MHz and 65\u00a0dBm/5\u00a0MHz in the FDD downlink band, noting that this limit can be increased for specific deployments, e.g. in areas of low population density provided that this does not significantly increase the risk of terminal station receiver blocking.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Out-of-block requirements\nTable 1\nBaseline requirements \u2014 base station BEM out-of-block EIRP limits per antenna\n\u00a0(7)\nFrequency range of out-of-block emissions of FDD downlink Maximum mean out-of-block EIRP Measurement bandwidth\nFrequencies spaced more than 10\u00a0MHz from the lower or upper block edge 9\u00a0dBm 5\u00a0MHz\nTable 2\nTransition requirements \u2014 base station BEM out-of-block EIRP limits per antenna\n\u00a0(8)\nFrequency range of out-of-block emissions of FDD downlink Maximum mean out-of-block EIRP Measurement bandwidth\n\u201310 to \u20135\u00a0MHz from lower block edge 11\u00a0dBm 5\u00a0MHz\n\u20135 to 0\u00a0MHz from lower block edge 16,3\u00a0dBm 5\u00a0MHz\n0 to +5\u00a0MHz from upper block edge 16,3\u00a0dBm 5\u00a0MHz\n+5 to +10\u00a0MHz from upper block edge 11\u00a0dBm 5\u00a0MHz\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Technical conditions for FDD terminal stations\nTable 3\nIn-block requirements \u2014 terminal station BEM in-block emission limit over frequencies of FDD uplink\nMaximum mean in-block power\u00a0(9) 24\u00a0dBm\u00a0(10)\nMember States may relax the limit set out in Table 3 for specific deployments, e.g. fixed terminal stations in rural areas provided that protection of other services, networks and applications is not compromised and cross-border obligations are fulfilled.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0TRP is a measure of how much power the antenna actually radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere.

EIRP and TRP are equivalent for isotropic antennas. It is recognised that this value may be subject to a tolerance defined in the harmonised standards to take account of operation under extreme environmental conditions and production spread.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0For the determination of out of band emissions of terminals in CEPT Report 39 the maximum conducted transmit power of 23\u00a0dBm has been used as a reference."}
