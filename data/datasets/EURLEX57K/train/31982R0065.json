Where an undertaking has taken a decision to carry forward but has not, in respect of the beet processed into the sugar to be carried forward, made a provisional payment corresponding to the minimum price for A beet in force during the marketing year in which it was produced, then that undertaking shall be bound to apportion with the beet producer the storage reimbursement for the period referred to in Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81.
