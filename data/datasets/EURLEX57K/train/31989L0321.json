In the case of whole carcases a specimen to be taken of approximately 2 g from a pillar of the diaphragm at the transition to the sinewy part. In the absence of diaphragm pillars, a specimen of the same size to be taken from the rib part of the breastbone, part of the diaphragm, from the jaw muscle or the abdomina muscle.\n2. For cuts of meat, a sample of approximately 2 g of skeletal muscle to be taken, containing little fat and, where possible, near to bones or tendons.\n(c) Method\n1. Digestion Procedure\n- Place the blender with filtration-insert, connect the waste tube and lead the tube to the waste bin.\n- When the blender is switched on, the heat-up will start.\n- Before start, the bottom valve, located below the reaction chamber, should be opened and closed.\n- Up to 35 samples of approximately 1 g each (at 25 to 30\u00b0C) taken from each of the individual samples, in accordance with point b, are then added. Make sure that larger pieces of tendons are removed as this may clot the membrane filter.\n- Pour water to the edge of a liquid chamber connected to the blender (approximately 400 ml).\n- Pour about 30 ml hydrochloric acid (8,5 %) to the edge of the smaller, connected liquid chamber.\n- Place a membrane filter under the coarse filter in the filter holder in the filter insert.\n- 5 g of pepsin is added last. The order of addition should be strictly adhered to in order to avoid decomposition of the pepsin.\n- Close the lids to the reaction- and liquid chambers.\n- Select the period of digestion. Short digestion period (5 minutes) for pigs at normal age of slaughtering and extended digestion time (8 minutes) for other samples. - The automatic dispensing starts when the start button on the blender is activated and digestion with following filtration will proceed automatically. After 10 to 13 minutes the process is completed and stops automatically.\n- The lid to the reaction chamber is opened once it is checked that the chamber is emptied. If there is foam or remains of digestion liquid in the chamber repeat the procedure according to point 4.\n2. Recovery of larvae\n- Dismount the filter holder and transfer the membrane filter to a slide or a Petri dish.\n- The membrane filter is examined by means of a microscope or a trichinoscope.\n3. Cleaning of equipment\n- In the case of a positive result, fill the reaction chamber in the blender 2 / 3 with boiling water. Ordinary tap-water is poured into the connecting liquid chamber until the lower level sensor is covered. The automatic cleaning programme is then carried out. De-contaminate the filter-holder together with the remaining equipment, for example by means of formal treatment.\n- After the day's work fill the liquid chamber in the blender with water and carry out a standard programme.\n4. Method to be used when digestion is incomplete and filtration cannot therefore be carried out\nWhen the automatic process in the blender is carried out according to point 1, open the lid to the reaction chamber and check whether there is foam or liquid remaining in the chamber. It this is the case, carry out the following procedure:\n- Close the bottom valve below the reaction chamber.\n- Dismount the filter holder and transfer the membrane filter to a slide or a Petri dish.\n- Put a new membrane filter in the filter holder and mount the filter holder.\n- Fill water into the liquid chamber in the blender until the lower level-sensor is covered.\n- Carry out the automatic cleaning programme.\n- After the cleaning programme has been completed open the lid to the reaction chamber and check for liquid remains.\n- If the chamber is empty, dismount the filter holder and transfer the membrane filter with a tweezer to a slide or a Petri dish.\n- The two membrane filters are examined according to point 2. If the filters cannot be examined repeat the entire digestion process with extended digestion time according to point 1.\n5. In the case of a positive or doubtful result, following the result of a collective sample, a further 20 g sample should be taken from each pig in accordance with point b above. These samples shall be investigated individually according to the abovementioned method.'"}
