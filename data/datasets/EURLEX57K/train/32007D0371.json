The creation of a new breed may imply the entry of animals from other breeds into the main section of a herd-book.\n(5) It is therefore necessary, during the period of establishment of a new herd-book, to provide for a derogation from the rule according to which only pure-bred animals of the same breed can enter the main section of the herd-book of a particular breed. This period of establishment should be defined in the breeding programme of the breeders' organization or association. In order to avoid confusion with the name of an existing breed a distinct name should be chosen for the new breed.\n(6) With a view to the progressive improvement of existing breeds, Decision 84/419/EEC allows the entry into the supplementary section of a herd-book of females from other breeds or non pure-bred females only. Their genes may be infused into the main section through their female progeny only.\n(7) In order to allow more flexibility to approved breeding organisations the entry of males into the supplementary section should also be allowed. In order to avoid uncontrolled genetic changes of the breed, their genes should be infused into the main section through their female progeny only.\n(8) In order to ensure the mutual recognition between herd-books of the same breed and to inform buyers of breeding animals and their germ products, the internal rules of officially recognised breeding organizations and associations should clearly mention the name of the breed and, in case of a new breed, define the establishing period.\n(9) It is furthermore necessary to include within the criteria for the recognition of organisations associations and for entering cattle in herd-books appropriate references to Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97\u00a0(4).\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Zootechnics,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 84/247/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "Decision 84/419/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
