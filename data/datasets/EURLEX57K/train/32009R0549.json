The current payment period of 120\u2013140 days should therefore be reduced to 45\u201365 days thereby providing a harmonisation of all payment periods for intervention products in the dairy sector.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 is amended as follows:\n1.
