The subsequent epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has made certain further amendments necessary.\n(2) It is convenient to introduce the possibility of buying-in carcasses weighing more than the maximum weight while restricting in that case the buying-in price to that of the maximum authorised weight. With regard to the purchase of forequarters, this restriction should be applied by limiting their buying-in price to 40 % of the maximum payable weight for carcasses.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 should therefore be amended.\n(4) In view of the development of events this Regulation must enter into force immediately.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 is replaced by the following: \"3.
