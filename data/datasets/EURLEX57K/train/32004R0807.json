Moreover, the Community financing rate should be differentiated according to the extent to which the project's economic benefits exceed its financial profitability.\n(2) To this end the High-Level Group recommended a higher rate of Community aid to promote completion of the cross-border connections for the priority projects and added that the budgetary impact of such a change would be limited. This should be implemented bearing in mind the need to focus TENs resources on key projects, while recognising the need for continued financial support for non-priority projects.\n(3) The possibility should be given to meet the budgetary commitments by means of annual instalments, while basing them on a global and multiannual legal commitment.\n(4) A temporary increase in the rate of Community aid may provide an incentive for actors to speed up and to render effective the implementation of priority projects covered by this Regulation.\n(5) The establishment of public-private partnerships (or of other forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors) demands a firm financial commitment from institutional investors which is sufficiently attractive to raise private capital. Granting Community financial aid on a multiannual basis would remove the uncertainties which are slowing down project development. Measures should therefore be taken to grant financial support to the projects selected on the basis of a multiannual legal commitment.\n(6) Cross-border connections between energy networks are important for ensuring smooth operation of the internal market, security of supply and optimum use of energy infrastructure. Priority projects on the energy networks, which are necessary in the interests of the European economy but unprofitable in business terms and which do not distort competition between enterprises, should therefore also qualify for higher financial aid. This aid is in respect of priority projects on the energy networks.\n(7) Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95(4) should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
