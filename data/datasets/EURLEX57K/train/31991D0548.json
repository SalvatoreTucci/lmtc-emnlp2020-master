However, this  improvement has not been fully reflected in production costs, which have risen steadily by over 30  % since 1985.\nIn addition, the undertaking Carbonifera do Douro has devised a business strategy aimed at  progressively reducing its production and workforce between 1990 and 1994, when total closure of  the undertaking is planned. This strategy was necessary partly because difficulties in mechanizing  the mine were pushing up production costs and partly because prospects for coal prices did not  indicate any improvement in the competitiveness of the undertaking's production capacity.\nIn the long term, this state of affairs would lead to a continual decline in competitiveness and  mounting operating losses which would have to be covered by ever higher subsidies.\nThe aid proposed will cover the difference between projected average costs and projected average  revenue for each tonne produced. The aid will not exceed expected operating losses and hence  complies with the conditions laid down in Article 3 (1) of the Decision.\nThis measure will facilitate gradual closure of the mine and hence contribute to solving the social  and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry, in accordance with the third  indent of Article 2 (1).\nIII In view of the foregoing and of the information supplied by the Portuguese authorities, the aid to  be granted to the current production of the Portuguese coal industry in 1990 is compatible with the  objectives of Decision N\u00b0 2064/86/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nIV Pursuant to Article 11 (2) of Decision N\u00b0 2064/86/ECSC, the Commission must ensure that the direct  aid to current production which it authorizes is used exclusively for the purposes set out in  Articles 3 and 6 thereof. It must therefore be informed of the amoutns of the payments and the  manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["Article 1\nPortugal is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Esc 828 290 000  to the coal industry to cover operating losses for the 1990 calendar year.", "Portugal shall inform the Commission at the latest by 31 December 1991 of the actual  amount of aid paid in 1990.", "This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 July 1991.\nFor the Commission Antonio CARDOSO E CUNHA Member of the Commission\n(1) OJ N\u00b0 L 177, 1. 7. 1986, p. 1.\n(2) OJ N\u00b0 L 5, 1. 7. 1986, p. 25."}
