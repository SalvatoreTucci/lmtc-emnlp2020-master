Tell-tale\n\"Tell-tale\" means an optical signal which indicates the actuation of a device, correct or defective functioning or condition, or failure to function.\n2.9. Symbol\n\"Symbol\" means a diagram identifying a control, a tell-tale or an indicator.\n2.10. Master lighting switch\n\"Master lighting switch\" means a switch connecting or cutting off the supply of current to the electrical circuits of the main/dipped-beam headlamps and lamp of the devices referred to in 3.11 of Annex I to Council Directive 76/756/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on motor vehicles and their trailers [1].\n2.11.

Fuel-level indicator\n\"Fuel-level indicator\" means a device which gives information on the amount of fuel in the tank.\n2.14. Fuel level tell-tale\n\"Fuel level tell-tale\" means a signal which when alight indicates that the fuel level is close to zero or that the vehicle is running on its fuel reserve.\n2.15. Engine coolant temperature indicator\n\"Engine coolant temperature indicator\" means a device which gives information on the temperature of the coolant.\n2.16. Engine coolant temperature tell-tale\n\"Engine coolant temperature tell-tale\" means a signal which when alight indicates that the temperature of the engine coolant is above the normal running temperature prescribed by the manufacturer.\n2.17. Oil pressure indicator\n\"Oil pressure indicator\" means a device which gives information on the pressure of the oil in the engine lubrication circuit.\n2.18. Oil pressure tell-tale\n\"Oil pressure tell-tale\" means a signal which when alight indicates that the oil pressure in the engine lubrication circuit is below the normal operating limit prescribed by the manufacturer.\n2.19. Safety belt tell-tale\n\"Safety belt tell-tale\" means a signal which when alight indicates that the buckle of the belt of at least one of the occupied seats is not locked.\n2.20.
