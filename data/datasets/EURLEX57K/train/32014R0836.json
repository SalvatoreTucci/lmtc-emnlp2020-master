In order to allow more time to establish detailed rules for the production of organic pullets, the exceptional provision for using non-organic pullets should be extended for three years.\n(3) Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 allows exceptionally, for calendar years 2012, 2013 and 2014, for a maximum of 5 % of non-organic protein feed to be used for porcine and poultry species.\n(4) Organic protein supply has not been available in sufficient quality and quantity on the Union market to meet the nutritional requirements of pigs and poultry raised on organic farms. The production of organic protein crops is still lagging behind demand. It is therefore appropriate to extend the exceptional possibility of using a limited proportion of non-organic protein feed for a limited time period.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory committee on organic production,", "main_body": ["Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008\nRegulation (EC) No 889/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Article 42(b), the date \u201831 December 2014\u2019 is replaced by the date \u201831 December 2017\u2019.\n(2) In Article 43, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:", "Entry into force and application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 July 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0189, 20.7.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 of 5 September 2008 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 834/2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products with regard to organic production, labelling and control (OJ L\u00a0250, 18.9.2008, p.\u00a01)."}
