The term \"Serrano\" is considered specific in itself in accordance with the first indent of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92, i.e. it is untranslatable. It must therefore be used as it stands. Furthermore, the term \"Serrano\" is registered without prejudice to the use of the term \"mountain\". There is no conflict between the two terms;\n(4) As a consequence, the name set out in the Annex should be entered in the Register of certificates of specific character and thereby protected as a traditional speciality guaranteed within the Community pursuant to Article 13(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92. This means that the name can only be used where the specification is complied with. However, a transitional period of three months should be allowed to use up stocks of the product not meeting the specification;\n(5) The Annex hereto supplements the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2301/97(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2527/98(4),", "main_body": ["The name set out in the Annex hereto is hereby added to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2301/97 and entered in the Register of certificates of specific character provided for in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 March 2000.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 November 1999.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 208, 24.7.1992, p. 1.\n(2) OJ C 371, 1.12.1998, p. 3.\n(3) OJ L 319, 21.11.1997, p. 8.\n(4) OJ L 317, 26.11.1998, p. 14.\nANNEX\n\"Jam\u00f3n Serrano\" (Article 13(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92(1).\n(1) The main points in the specification are set out in OJ C 371, 1.12.1998, p. 3."}
