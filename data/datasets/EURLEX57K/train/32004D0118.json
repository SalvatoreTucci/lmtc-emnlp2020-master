poultry disease surveillance and monitoring programmes; the development of appropriate contingency plans for poultry diseases; and, the development of the veterinary acquis in regard to general veterinary legislation and legislation in the poultry sector in advance of EU accession, has demonstrated that Estonia, Malta, Latvia and Lithuania have sufficiently well structured and organised veterinary services regarding the animal health status for live poultry and ratites.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to add Lithuania, Estonia and Malta to the list of third countries that are, in principle, authorised to import live poultry and hatching eggs including ratites and eggs as laid down in Commission Decision 95/233/EC.\n(6) Commission Decision 96/482/EC and Commission Decision 2001/751/EC should also be amended to include Estonia, Malta, Latvia and Lithuania.\n(7) Commission Decision 94/85/EC(10) establishes a list of third countries from which importation of fresh poultry meat is authorised.\n(8) Commission Decision 94/984/EC(11) lays down animal health conditions and veterinary certificates for the importation of fresh poultry meat from third countries.\n(9) Commission Decision 2000/609/EC(12) establishes animal and public health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of farmed ratite meat.\n(10) Because of the improved animal health status of the Acceding States in relation to poultry, Estonia should be added to the list of third countries that are, in principle, authorised to import fresh poultrymeat into the EU as laid down in Commission Decision 94/85/EC. This will also allow Estonia to be authorised to import wild feathered game meat as laid down in Commission Decision 94/86/EC(13).\n(11) It is also appropriate to include Estonia, Malta and Latvia in Commission Decision 94/984/EC for the importation of fresh poultrymeat, and in Commission Decision 2000/609/EC for the importation of live ratites and hatching eggs.\n(12) Commission Decision 2000/585/EC(14) lays down animal and public health conditions and veterinary certifications for import of wild and farmed game meat and rabbit meat from third countries. In order to take account of the improved health status of the Acceding States, Malta should be added to the list of authorised third countries, and the existing third country lists and the specific conditions under which wild and farmed game meat and rabbit meat can be imported into the EU from other Acceding States should also be updated.\n(13) Commission Decision 97/222/EC(15) establishes a list of third countries or parts of third countries from which the importation of meat products is authorised.\n(14) Certain Acceding States continue to present an animal health risk associated with Classical Swine Fever in wild boar populations. In order to reflect both this but also the improved animal health status in the Acceding States, Commission Decision 97/222/EC should be amended.\n(15) It is opportune, where appropriate, to update certain country names, ISO codes and regionalisation definitions.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 95/233/EC are replaced by the text in Annex I and Annex II to this Decision.", "Annex I to Decision 96/482/EC is replaced by the text in Annex III to this Decision.", "Annex I to Decision 2001/751/EC is replaced by the Annex IV to this Decision.", "The Annex to Decision 94/85/EC is replaced by Annex V to this Decision.", "Annex I to Decision 94/984/EC is replaced by Annex VI to this Decision.", "Annex I to Decision 2000/609/EC is replaced by Annex VII to this Decision.", "Annex I to Decision 2000/585/EC is replaced by the text in Annex VIII to this Decision.", "Annex II to Decision 2000/585/EC is replaced by the text in Annex IX to this Decision.", "Part I of the Annex to Decision 97/222/EC is replaced by the text in Annex X to this Decision.", "0\nPart II of the Annex to Decision 97/222/EC is replaced by the text in Annex XI to this Decision.", "1\nThis Decision shall apply from 14 February 2004.", "2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 January 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 302, 31.12.1972, p. 28.
