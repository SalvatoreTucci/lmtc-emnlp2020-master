In that report it came to the conclusion that an additional assessment was required.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 12 March 2009. Several Member States submitted additional comments.\n(4) Therefore the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on 27 August 2009.\n(5) On 9 July 2010, EFSA (Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies) in the \u2018Scientific opinion on the safety of \u201cchitin-glucan\u201d as a novel food ingredient\u2019\u00a0(2) came to the conclusion that chitin-glucan from Aspergillus niger was safe under the proposed conditions of use and the proposed levels of intake.\n(6) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that chitin-glucan from Aspergillus niger complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Chitin-glucan from Aspergillus niger as specified in the Annex may be placed on the market in the Union as a novel food ingredient to be used in food supplements with a maximum dose of 5\u00a0g per day.", "The designation of chitin-glucan from Aspergillus niger authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuff containing it shall be \u2018chitin-glucan from Aspergillus niger\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Kitozyme SA, Rue Haute Claire, 4, Parc Industriel des Hauts-Sarts, Zone 2, 4040 Herstal, Belgium."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 February 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(7): 1687.\nANNEX\nSPECIFICATIONS OF CHITIN-GLUCAN FROM ASPERGILLUS NIGER MYCELIUM\nDescription\nChitin-glucan is obtained from the mycelium of Aspergillus niger, it is a slightly yellow, odourless, free-flowing powder.
