Articles 14, 15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund, in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods\u2019 arrival at destination.\n(3) In the case of a differentiated refund, Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest refund rate, is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.\n(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004 of 24 September 2004 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Bulgaria and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Bulgaria\u00a0(4), provides on an autonomous basis for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Bulgaria, from 1 October 2004.\n(5) Bulgaria has undertaken to grant the preferential import arrangements to goods imported into its territory only if the goods concerned are accompanied by documents stating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds.\n(6) In the light of those arrangements, as a transitory measure in view of the possible accession to the European Union of Bulgaria and in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries, it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate, where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question, not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined.\n(7) Since the autonomous and transitional measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004 will apply as from 1 October 2004 this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, where the differentiation of the refund is the result solely of a refund not having been fixed for Bulgaria proof that the customs import formalities have been completed shall not be a condition for payment of the refund in respect of all goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, which are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004.", "The fact that no export refund has been fixed in respect of the export to Bulgaria of the goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, which are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004, shall not be taken into account in determining the lowest rate of refund within the meaning of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 September 2004.\nFor the Commission\nOlli REHN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 318, 20.12.1993, p. 18.
