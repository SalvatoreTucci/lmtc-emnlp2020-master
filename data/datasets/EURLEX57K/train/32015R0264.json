Article 10 provides for the re-evaluation of a feed additive pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for piglets, dogs, calves and ovines. This substance was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives established in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of neohesperidine dihydrochalcone as a feed additive for piglets suckling and weaned, pigs for fattening, calves for rearing, calves for fattening, sheep and dogs. An application was also submitted in accordance with Article\u00a07 of that Regulation for a new use via water for drinking for those species and categories of animals and for a new use for fish. The applicant requested this additive to be classified in the category \u2018sensory additives\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(3) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 15\u00a0November 2011\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use in feed for all species concerned except fish, neohesperidine dihydrochalcone does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority further concluded in the subsequent opinion of 9 April 2014\u00a0(4) that the use of neohesperidine dihydrochalcone as a feed additive for fish does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority considered that no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary since its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(4) The assessment shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this substance should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(5) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The substance specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018sensory additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018Flavourings compounds\u2019, is authorised as additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The substance specified in the Annex and premixtures containing that substance, which are produced and labelled before 11 September 2015 in accordance with the rules applicable before 11 March 2015 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted if they are intended for pigs, calves sheep and dogs.\nCompound feed, feed materials containing that substance which are produced and labelled before 11 September 2015 in accordance with the rules applicable before 11 March 2015 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted if they are intended for pigs, calves and sheep.\nCompound feed and feed materials containing that substance which are produced and labelled before 11 March 2017 in accordance with the rules applicable before 11 March 2015 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted if they are intended for dogs.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011;9(12):2444.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014;12(5):3669.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nmg/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12 %.\nCategory: Sensory additives.
