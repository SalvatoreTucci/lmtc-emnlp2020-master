Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom apply their specific entry rules relating to echinococcosis; Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom require pet dogs and cats to undergo additional treatment against ticks that must also be certified in the animals\u2019 passports.\n(4) The transitional regimes provided for in Articles\u00a06 and\u00a016 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003 expire on 3\u00a0July 2008. Article\u00a023 of that Regulation provides that the transitional regimes are to be reviewed before the end of the transitional period.\n(5) To that end and pursuant to Article\u00a023 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003, the Commission was required to submit to the European Parliament and to the Council, before 1\u00a0February 2007, a report on the need to maintain the serological test, together with appropriate proposals for determining the regime to be applied after the transitional regimes provided for in Articles\u00a06, 8 and\u00a016 of that Regulation. That report should be based on the experience gained so far and on a risk evaluation, to be based on a scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\n(6) At the Commission\u2019s request, EFSA issued a scientific opinion to assist the Commission in proposing appropriate, science-based amendments to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003. In addition the Commission had also to consider reports by Member States on their experience with the implementation of Articles\u00a06, 8 and\u00a016 of that Regulation.\n(7) However, because the scientific assessment has taken longer than envisaged, the Commission\u2019s report has been delayed. To enable sufficient account to be taken of the conclusions of the report, the expiry of the transitional regimes should be postponed.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a0998/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article\u00a06(1), the introductory phrase shall be replaced by the following:\n2. in Article\u00a016, the first paragraph shall be replaced by the following:\n3. in Article\u00a023, the date \u20181\u00a0January 2008\u2019 shall be replaced by the date \u20181\u00a0July 2010\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 21\u00a0May 2008.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.
