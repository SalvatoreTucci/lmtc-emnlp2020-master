Sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) are added to stop oxidation and inhibit the growth of micro-organisms. It also prevents the growth of unwanted yeasts during the second fermentation in bottles. Propane-1, 2-diol alginate (E 405) are added to stabilise the foam, so that the carbon dioxide bubbles do not dissipate, making for a creamier and longer-lasting head.\n(6) Acceptable daily intakes have been established by the Scientific Committee for Food for sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228)\u00a0(3) and for propane-1, 2-diol alginate (E 405)\u00a0(4). Fermented grape must-based drinks are alcoholic beverages which due to their properties are comparable to other alcoholic beverages such as beer and malt beverages. Consumption of these drinks can thus be considered as an alternative to the consumption of other alcoholic beverages, in particular beer and malt beverages. The additional exposure to sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) and to propane-1, 2-diol alginate (E 405) based on this new use will remain limited and will not lead to an increase of the overall intake. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) as preservatives and of propane-1, 2-diol alginate (E 405) as a foam stabiliser in fermented grape must-based drinks.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) as preservatives and of propane-1, 2-diol alginate (E 405) as a foam stabiliser in fermented grape must-based drinks constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(8) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011\u00a0(5) the list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 applies in principle from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) and of propane-1, 2-diol alginate (E 405) in fermented grape must-based drinks before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to this use of those food additives.\n(9) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 December 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/reports/scf_reports_35.pdf\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/reports/scf_reports_32.pdf\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 295, 12.11.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the following entries are inserted in numerical order in food category 14.2.8 \u2018Other alcoholic drinks including mixtures of alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic drinks and spirits with less than 15\u00a0% alcohol\u2019:\n\u2018E 220-228 Sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites 20 (3) only in fermented grape must-based drinks Period of application:\nE 405 Propane-1, 2-diol alginate 100  only in fermented grape must-based drinks Period of application:\n(3): Maximum levels are expressed as SO2 relate to the total quantity, available from all sources, an SO2 content of not more than 10\u00a0mg/kg or 10\u00a0mg/l is not considered to be present.\u2019"}
