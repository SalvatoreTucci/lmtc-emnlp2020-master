whereas the quantities harvested from 1 January to 20 April and in October, November and December are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for  these periods; whereas reference prices should be fixed only for the period 21 April up to and including 30 September;\nWhereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:\n- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and\n- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;\nWhereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity  growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;\nWhereas, to take seasonal price variations into account, the marketing year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;\nWhereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards  market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 establishes a list of prices and amounts for the fruit and vegetables sector which are to be divided by a coefficient of 1,002583, fixed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 537/93 (7), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No  1331/93 (8), as from the beginning of the 1993/94 marketing year;\nWhereas Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 lays down that the resulting reduction in the prices and amounts for each sector concerned shall be specified and the level of such reduced prices fixed; whereas, however, this adjustment may not result  in a reference price level below that of the preceding marketing year, in accordance with Article 23 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["For the 1994 marketing year, the reference prices for courgettes falling within CN code 0709 90 70, expressed in ecu per 100 kilograms net of packed products of class I, of all sizes, shall be as follows:\n- April (21 to 30): 71,79,\n- May: 63,12,\n- June: 42,18,\n- July: 38,56,\n- August: 44,91,\n- September: 49,60.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 21 April 1994.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 March 1994.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 118, 20. 5. 1972, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 338, 31. 12. 1993, p. 26.\n(3) OJ No L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 320, 22. 12. 1993, p. 32.\n(5) OJ No L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 29.\n(6) OJ No L 158, 30. 6. 1993, p. 18.\n(7) OJ No L 57, 10. 3. 1993, p. 18.\n(8) OJ No L 132, 29. 5. 1993, p. 114."}
