In particular, its Article 22(1)(a) and (b) lays down general restrictions on uses of animal by-products and processed products.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 197/2006\u00a0(2) on transitional measures under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 as regards the collection, transport, treatment, use and disposal of former foodstuffs sets out a number of transitional measures that are due to expire on 31 July 2007. In particular, Article 3(c) of Regulation (EC) No 197/2006 provides that Member States may authorise former foodstuffs to be used in feed or for other purposes, without further treatment, subject to certain conditions set out therein.\n(3) The economic operators concerned by those transitional measures have asked for the period of validity of such measures to be extended, and it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.\n(4) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate to clearly specify that the uses that may be authorised under Article 3(c) of Regulation (EC) No 197/2006 do not affect the general restrictions set out in Article 22(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 197/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 197/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
