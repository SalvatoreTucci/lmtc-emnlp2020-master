Those aggregations, known as the \"Darwin Mounds\", appear to be in good conservation status but show signs of damage owing to bottom-trawling operations.\n(4) Scientific reports show that those types of aggregations constitute habitats that host important and highly diverse biological communities. The habitats are considered in many fora as requiring priority protection. In particular, the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention) has recently included deepwater coral reefs in a list of endangered habitats.\n(5) Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora includes reefs within the natural habitats of Community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation(4). The United Kingdom has formally expressed its intention to designate the Darwin Mounds as a special area of conservation with a view to protecting that type of habitat in fulfilment of its obligations provided for by the said directive.\n(6) According to the scientific evidence, recovery from damage to coral produced by trawl gear towed through the bottom is either impossible or very difficult and slow. It is therefore appropriate to prohibit the use of bottom trawls and similar gear in the area surrounding the Darwin Mounds.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 850/98 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 850/98, the following paragraph 4 shall be added:\n\"4.
