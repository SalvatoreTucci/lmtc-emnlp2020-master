In order to allow the importation of equidae, their semen, ova and embryos to continue from the disease free parts of the territory of Brazil, the Commission adopted Decision 2008/804/EC\u00a0(4) excluding the State of S\u00e3o Paulo from the list of territories of Brazil set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC.\n(4) In the light of the information and guarantees provided by Brazil, and taking into account that at least 6 months have elapsed since the case of glanders was detected and the infected animal destroyed, the State of S\u00e3o Paulo should be reinstated in the list of territories of Brazil in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC in order to allow the importation of equidae and imports of semen, ova and embryos of equine species to resume from this part of the territory of Brazil. The entry for Brazil in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) A veterinary inspection mission carried out in Mauritius recorded shortcomings that require to limit the introduction into the Community of equidae from that country to registered horses complying with the animal health conditions laid down in Annex\u00a0II(E) to Commission Decision 93/197/EEC of 5 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production\u00a0(5). Those conditions require amongst others a complete residence period of 3 months and a pre-export isolation in an approved isolation centre protected from vector insects to avoid the introduction of disease into the Community. The entry for Mauritius in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
