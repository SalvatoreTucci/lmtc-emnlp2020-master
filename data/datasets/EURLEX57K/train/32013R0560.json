Skills which have been passed down from generation to generation.\nThe port of Grimsby is unique in England in that it is sited on a promontory, which separates the Humber Estuary from the North Sea. This position exposes the port to cool dry winds off the sea and estuary which aid the process of traditional fish smoking by keeping mean summer maximum temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, which is significantly cooler than inland.\nAcross the UK the town of Grimsby is synonymous with the processing of fish. The port and town regard it as a matter of pride that for over a century the many fish merchants have been able to supply most types of fish to anywhere in the country and more recently even further into Europe. \u2018Traditional Grimsby Smoked Fish\u2019 is one of the most important products associated with the port.\nThe tradition and processes involved can be proven and demonstrated back to the late 19th century. Grimsby has been synonymous with fish smoking in the UK since 1850 when the railway first allowed the rapid transportation of smoked fish to London and eventually to every corner of the country. At that time, of course, no refrigeration equipment or ice making capability now used so extensively in the preservation of fresh and perishable produce such as fish existed. In order to keep and extend the shelf-life of their perishable products the choice was salting, drying, smoking or a combination of all of these. Traditional fish smoking in Grimsby has continued to be successful despite the preference for mechanical kilns in other parts of the country.\nFor much of the first half of the 20th century the port of Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world. Its position amongst names such as Vigo, Esbjerg, Boulogne sur Mer and Bremerhaven with which the town is twinned is unassailable. The town today is still the largest centre of fish production in the UK with 106 companies currently members of the Grimsby Fish Merchants Association. This diverse merchanting base has always been the port\u2019s strength and has resulted in Grimsby Fish Markets pivotal role in wet fish sales not only in the UK but also at a European level.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2018Traditional Grimsby Smoked Fish\u2019 are fillets of cod and haddock, weighing between 200 and 700\u00a0grams. They are cream to beige in colour, with a dry texture and a smoked slightly salty flavour. The fillets of fish have been cold smoked in accordance with traditional methods and skilled know-how which has been handed down over generations these include:\nfilleting the whole fish by hand,\nbrining the fillets of fish,\nplacing the filleted fish on speats, in the smokehouse chimneys at heights that suit the cold smoking process.\nPreparing the base of the smokehouse to be laid with a covering of sawdust where \u2018fire\u2019 is introduced to start the sawdust smouldering. Monitoring the rate at which the fish is smoked is dependent on the size of the fish, and the ambient temperature and humidity.\nRegular monitoring of the smoking process by skilled smokers is carried out to ensure the fish is smoked evenly, moving and removing fish when necessary.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nGrimsby\u2019s position on the east coast has a second advantage of being a place in the UK which is least prone to humid rain bearing south westerly winds which prevail in most other parts of the UK. It has a maritime climate, which means that although there are only small fluctuations in seasonal weather on a day to day basis the weather can be changeable.\nThe experience and expertise required to smoke fish successfully in the traditional way can only be learnt over many years with the knowledge often being handed down over generations. This in contrast to the modern mechanical kiln, which is a sealed oven that is electrically heated and regulated simply by turning dials. Due to these sustainable sources and being able to take advantage of Grimsby\u2019s strategic position at the centre of a chilled fish distribution network daily supplies of freshly smoked fish can be guaranteed anywhere in the country.\nGrimsby is fortunate in that it can source its fish from such a wide area that an experienced buyer can normally find some fish which is suitable for smoking whatever time of the year. In order to smoke the fish successfully the fish smoker has to allow for the many variables of fish, season and weather. In Grimsby generations of expertise enables the traditional fish smoker to produce a consistent quality product by touch and eye alone.\n\u2018Traditional Grimsby Smoked Fish\u2019 is highly praised by the food industry at large, such as Waitrose whose fish buyer has stated that \u2018With modern-day kilns you just don\u2019t get that depth of flavour. With traditional fish, it\u2019s like eating something completely different. The real thing is amazing. Unbeatable. Smoky. Rich. Perfect.\u2019 Equally the traditional fish smoking methods are well appreciated by chefs alike. Rick Stein states \u2018I\u2019ve visited Grimsby and was amazed at the skill involved in traditional fish smoking. It\u2019s worlds apart from computer-controlled kiln drying.\u2019\nChef Mitch Tonks also believes the traditional smoking method makes all the difference to taste of the fish and enhances its organoleptic qualities; \u2018They cure their fish in the traditional way and smoke them in old smokehouses which smell gorgeous, and I\u2019m sure this helps the flavour. They use only large haddocks and the result is a perfect balance of smoke and sweet fish.\u2019\nGrimsby smoked fish is served in many of the country\u2019s finest eateries, including J Sheekey, Scott\u2019s and even Delia Smith\u2019s Norwich City Football Club\u2019s restaurant. Regular supplies are sent to the Royal household. Legend has it that the Queen ate it for breakfast the morning after her 1947 marriage to Prince Philip.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\nhttp://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/food/industry/regional/foodname/products/documents/grimsby-fish-spec-120619.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
