The Commission has published in the Official Journal of the European Communities successive lists of applicants(5) for which payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97.\n(2) The Commission requested and received the necessary information from the parties listed in Article 1 of this Decision and found each of their requests to be admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97. The information provided was examined and verified where necessary at the premises of the parties concerned.\n(3) The facts as finally ascertained by the Commission show that the assembly operations of the applicants concerned do not fall within the scope of Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96. In particular, it was found that for all the applicants' bicycle assembly operations, the value of the parts originating in the People's Republic of China which were used in their assembly operations was lower than 60 % of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations.\n(4) For the above reasons, and in accordance with Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97, the parties listed in Article 1 should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty. The parties concerned were informed accordingly and given an opportunity to comment.\n(5) In accordance with Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97, the exemption of the parties listed in Article 1 from the extended anti-dumping duty should take effect as from the date of receipt of their request and their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from that date.\n(6) A number of other parties, listed in Article 2 of this Decision, also requested an exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty but failed however to submit the necessary information requested by the Commission. Consequently, those parties should not be exempted under Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97. The Commission informed the parties concerned that it intended to reject their requests for exemption from the extended duty, on the grounds that they had failed to provide the information or supporting evidence requested.\n(7) Since the parties listed in Article 2 failed to meet the criteria for exemption, the suspension of payment of the extended anti-dumping duty should be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty should be collected as from the date of receipt of their requests.\n(8) Following the adoption of this Decision, an updated list of parties exempted pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 and of parties whose requests pursuant to Article 3 of that Regulation are under examination should be published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Communities in accordance with Article 16(2) of that Regulation,", "main_body": ["The parties listed below are hereby exempted from the extension by Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93, and maintained by Regulation (EC) No 1524/2000, on bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People's Republic of China.\nThe exemptions shall take effect in relation to each party as from the relevant date shown in the column headed \"Date of effect\".\nExempted parties\n>TABLE>", "The requests for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty made in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 by the parties listed below are hereby rejected.\nThe suspension of payment of the extended anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 is hereby lifted for the parties concerned as from the relevant date shown in the column headed \"Date of effect\".\nParties for which the suspension is lifted\n>TABLE>", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States and to the parties listed hereunder:\nTecno Bike s.a.s. di Tontini Donatella, Via del Lavoro s.n., I-61030 Canavaccio di Urbino (PU);\nSIMPLON Fahrrad GmbH, Oberer Achdamm 22, A-6971 Hard;\nIntersens Bikes &  Parts B.V., Bedrijvenpark Twente 170, 7602 KE Almelo, Netherlands;\nVICINI di Vicini Ottavio e Figli s.n.c., Via dell'Artigianato, 284, I-47023 Cesena (FO);\nA &  J Europe Bicycle Manufacturing Ltd, Unit G, Mochdre Enterprise Park, Newtown, Powys SY16 4LE, United Kingdom;\nSpeedcross di Torretta P. e C. s.n.c., Corso Italia 20, I-20020 Vanzaghello (MI);\nLenardon Lida/Cicli Bandiziol, Via Provinciale, 5, I-33096 San Martino al Tagliamento (PN);\nCARRARO SpA Industria Cicli, Via Alcide de Gasperi, 15, I-35030 Saccolongo (PD);\nB\u00f8rge Kildemoes Cykelfabrik A/S, Nr.
