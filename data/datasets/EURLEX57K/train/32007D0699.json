The period of application of the derogation provided for in Directive 92/33/EEC for such imports should consequently be extended beyond 31 December 2007.\n(4) Directive 92/33/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Materials for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["In the first subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Directive 92/33/EEC, the date \u201831 December 2007\u2019 is replaced by \u201831\u00a0December 2012\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 October 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 157, 10.6.1992, p. 1.
