The provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to Directive 95/1/EC.\n(2) In order to enable the full type-approval system to function properly, it is necessary to clarify or supplement certain requirements of Directive 95/1/EC.\n(3) To that end, it is necessary to specify the values to be entered in the test report to ensure the consistent application of Directive 95/1/EC in the case of mopeds, motorcycles and tricycles with spark-ignition engines and two- or three-wheel motor vehicles with compression-ignition engines.\n(4) Directive 95/1/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13 of Council Directive 70/156/EEC(4), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/116/EC(5),", "main_body": ["The Annexes to Directive 95/1/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.

With effect from 1 January 2004, Member States shall refuse to grant EC type-approval for any new type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicle on grounds relating to the maximum design speed, maximum torque and maximum net engine power if the requirements of Directive 95/1/EC, as amended by this Directive, are not fulfilled.", "1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 30 June 2003 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
