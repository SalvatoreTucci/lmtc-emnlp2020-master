In order to preserve the vulnerable species Baltic salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta m trutta) and whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus lavaretus), restocking in the River Kymijoki and River Summanjoki watercourse is necessary. Finland has submitted amendments to its programme providing for transfer of live eggs from wild fish from the Pyht\u00e4\u00e4 restriction zone provided that all appropriate measures are taken to ensure that the eggs are free of VHS and IHN. Delimitation of the zone as established in Annex I to Decision 2002/304/EC does not change.\n(4) By letter dated 4 March 2003, the veterinary authority of Italy proposed an amendment to the programme listed in point 5.1 of Annex I to Decision 2002/304/EC. In order to increase the level of protection as regards introduction of fish into the area covered by the programme, live trout and other fish destined to restaurants for direct consumption as well as rainbow trout intended for introduction into certain artificial lakes or fish water, must come from farms or areas recognised as free of VHS and IHN. Delimitation of the zone as established in Annex I to Decision 2002/304/EC does not change.\n(5) The amendments submitted have been found to comply with Article 10 of Directive 91/67/EEC and should therefore be approved.\n(6) Decision 2002/304/EC has been amended several times. In the interests of clarity and rationality, it should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.
