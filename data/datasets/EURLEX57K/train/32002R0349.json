In particular it reduces tariff quota C by 100000 tonnes and reserves access to it for products originating in the ACP countries. As a result of those amendments, it should be borne in mind that the structures of the trade in products originating in the ACP countries feature greater integration of the various commercial operations, which are carried out to a large extent by traditional operators as defined in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001. In order to ensure the continuity of import flows and at the same time to allocate non-traditional operators a share of tariff quota C that enables them to continue their activities in this trade and in order to foster sound competition, the allocation of tariff quota C among traditional and non-traditional operators should be adjusted and Article 2 of the abovementioned Regulation should be amended accordingly. The new allocation should correspond more closely to the operations actually carried out by each of the two categories of operators over the last three years.\n(3) The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 lists the authorities competent in the Member States to issue licences for importing bananas from third countries. Following notifications from several Member States, that Annex should be amended.\n(4) This Regulation must enter into force immediately in view of the time limits laid down in Regulation (EC) No 896/2001.\n(5) The Management Committee for Bananas has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
