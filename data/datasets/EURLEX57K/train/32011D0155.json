Updates of national rules may affect rules\u2019 classification in respect of other Member States\u2019 rules for a specific parameter set out in Section 1 of Annex VII to Directive 2008/57/EC.\n(4) It is necessary that the database cross-referencing national rules and classifying their equivalence is kept up-to-date.\n(5) The European Railway Agency (\u2018the Agency\u2019) should, in respect of each Member State, be responsible for the compilation, publication and maintenance of a list of national vehicle authorisation rules that references the national rule for each parameter and the classification of other Member States rules for this parameter. These lists should form a part of the reference document.\n(6) Consistency between the rules listed in the reference document and the rules notified pursuant to Article 17 of Directive 2008/57/EC should be ensured by Member States. To this end Member States should have a sufficient time for updating the reference document or for notifying/amend/withdraw rules under the procedure of Article 17. Until both sets of rules are aligned and a single data entry for national rules is available, National Safety Authorities (NSAs) may use the rules listed in the reference document for the purpose of granting authorisations for placing vehicles in service, in the case of any discrepancy between the two set of rules.\n(7) Moreover, as regards the notification of national safety rules in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), they are not relevant for the reference document. Indeed, Directive 2008/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) amended that Directive so as to remove from Annex II to Directive 2004/49/EC the national safety rules related to requirements for the authorisation of placing in service and maintenance of vehicles.\n(8) When compiling national reference documents, NSAs should determine priorities according to the objectives of Directive 2008/57/EC, taking account of the resources available within the NSAs after discussion in the relevant working parties.\n(9) In accordance with Article 27(4) of Directive 2008/57/EC the Commission should be allowed at any time to adopt a measure addressed to the Agency with a view to modifying the reference document.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 29(1) of Directive 2008/57/EC,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The content of the reference document referred to in Article 27(4) of Directive 2008/57/EC is specified in the Annex to this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall publish and maintain the reference document.
