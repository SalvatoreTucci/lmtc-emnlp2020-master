It was the first case of BSE in a small ruminant under natural conditions.\n(4) In its statement of 28 January 2005, the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stressed that the significance of that single case of BSE infection in a goat in France is yet to be assessed. In order to do so, the EFSA indicated that the results of an increased monitoring of TSEs in goats are essential.\n(5) In response to that statement, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\u00a0(4), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 214/2005\u00a0(5), introduced a new programme for the monitoring of TSE in caprine animals starting from 11 February 2005. Under that new monitoring programme, the numbers of healthy slaughter and dead-on-farm caprine animals to be tested have been substantially increased.\n(6) Due to the particularities of the goat meat sector, the limited value of goats above 18 months of age for slaughter purposes, and in the light of the importance of an effective implementation of the increased monitoring to assess the prevalence of BSE in caprine animals, it is appropriate to increase the amount per test to be reimbursed to the Member States by the Community up to a maximum amount of EUR 30 per rapid test performed in caprine animals.\n(7) In addition, Regulation (EC) 999/2001, as amended Commission Regulation (EC) No 36/2005\u00a0(6) sets out the compulsory systematic discriminatory testing to differentiate BSE from scrapie in all TSE cases detected in ovine and caprine animals to apply from 14 January 2005. That measure should be considered as eligible for the Community\u2019s financial contribution to the TSE monitoring and eradication programmes in the Member States.\n(8) In the light of the importance to assess the prevalence of BSE in small ruminants for the achievement of Community objectives in the field of public and animal health it is appropriate to reimburse 100% of the costs paid by the Member States for the primary molecular tests to differentiate BSE from scrapie.\n(9) Therefore, it is necessary to revise the maximum amount of financial participation by the Community for each programme, as set out in Decisions 2004/696/EC and 2004/863/EC.\n(10) Decision 2004/863/EC sets out the conditions for the Community\u2019s financial contribution, including the forwarding of a monthly report to the Commission by the concerned Member States on the progress of the TSE monitoring programmes and the cost paid. The Annex to that sets out the costs to be paid. That Annex should be amended to take account of amendments to Annexes III and X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 36/2005 and No 214/2005.\n(11) Decisions 2004/696/EC and 2004/863/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2004/696/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision.", "Decision 2004/863/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(2), \u2018EUR 3\u00a0550\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 3\u00a0586\u00a0000\u2019;\n2. in Article 2(2), \u2018EUR 1\u00a0700\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0736\u00a0000\u2019;\n3. in Article 3(2), \u2018EUR 2\u00a0375\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 2\u00a0426\u00a0000\u2019;\n4. in Article 4(2), \u2018EUR 15\u00a0020\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 15\u00a0170\u00a0000\u2019;\n5. in Article 5(2), \u2018EUR 290\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 294\u00a0000\u2019;\n6. in Article 6(2), \u2018EUR 585\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0487\u00a0000\u2019;\n7. in Article 7(2), \u2018EUR 4\u00a0780\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 8\u00a0846\u00a0000\u2019;\n8. in Article 8(2), \u2018EUR 24\u00a0045\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 29\u00a0755\u00a0000\u2019;\n9. in Article 9(2), \u2018EUR 6\u00a0170\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 6\u00a0172\u00a0000\u2019;\n10. in Article 10(2), \u2018EUR 6\u00a0660\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 8\u00a0677\u00a0000\u2019;\n11. in Article 11(2), \u2018EUR 85\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 353\u00a0000\u2019;\n12. in Article 12(2), \u2018EUR 835\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 836\u00a0000\u2019;\n13. in Article 13(2), \u2018EUR 145\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 155\u00a0000\u2019;\n14. in Article 14(2), \u2018EUR 1\u00a0085\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0184\u00a0000\u2019;\n15. in Article 15(2), \u2018EUR 35\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 36\u00a0000\u2019;\n16. in Article 16(2), \u2018EUR 4\u00a0270\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 4\u00a0510\u00a0000\u2019;\n17. in Article 17(2), \u2018EUR 1\u00a0920\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 2\u00a0076\u00a0000\u2019;\n18. in Article 18(2), \u2018EUR 1\u00a0135\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0480\u00a0000\u2019;\n19. in Article 19(2), \u2018EUR 435\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 444\u00a0000\u2019;\n20. in Article 20(2), \u2018EUR 1\u00a0160\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0170\u00a0000\u2019;\n21. in Article 21(2), \u2018EUR 305\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 313\u00a0000\u2019;\n22. in Article 22(2), \u2018EUR 5\u00a0570\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 5\u00a0690\u00a0000\u2019;\n23.
