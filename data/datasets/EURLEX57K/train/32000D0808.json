The additional aid and the aid already provided for may be modulated according to the alcohol content of the wine but may in no circumstances exceed EUR 25,56 (DEM 50) in total.\n(6) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance which has arisen, to be compatible with the common market on the terms specified in this Decision,", "main_body": ["Exceptional additional aid by the German authorities for the distillation of a maximum quantity of 350000 hectolitres of wine in the Land of Rhineland Palatinate, amounting to a maximum of EUR 4,38 million (DEM 8,57 million), including administrative expenditure, shall be considered to be compatible with the common market.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2000.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
