It also shows that the amount of State aid for restructuring purposes as specified in the plan is strictly limited to what is necessary to allow the company concerned to reach viability and will be progressively reduced and stopped by 2005. The assessment provides also that a global rationalisation and reduction of excess capacity of the beneficiary company will be reached. The assessment therefore concludes that the restructuring programme and the business plan meet the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement,", "main_body": ["The restructuring programme and business plan submitted to the Commission by Bulgaria pursuant to Article 2 of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, of the other part, with regard to an extension of the period laid down in Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement, are in compliance with the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2.", "The period during which Bulgaria may exceptionally, as regards steel products, grant public aid for restructuring purposes in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 is hereby extended by an additional period of eight years starting on 1 January 1998 or until the date of Bulgaria's accession to the European Union, whichever comes first, as foreseen by Article 1 of the Additional Protocol."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 18 October 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
