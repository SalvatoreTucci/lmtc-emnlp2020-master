Some of them have chosen to process only compliant milk and should therefore be deleted from the list in Chapter II of the Annex to Decision 2007/27/EC. Other establishments have chosen to process compliant and non-compliant milk without separation and should therefore be deleted from that list and added to the list in Chapter I of that Annex.\n(4) Furthermore, certain establishments which do not fulfil all Community structural requirements should be deleted from the lists of the Annex to Decision 2007/27/EC.\n(5) Decision 2007/27/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) For the sake of clarity, the Annex to Decision 2007/27/EC should be replaced.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion with the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2007/27/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 August 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 8, 13.1.2007, p. 45.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nCHAPTER I\nList of milk processing establishments in compliance with Community structural requirements authorised to receive and process without separation compliant and non-compliant milk\nNo Veterinary approval Name of the establishment Address\n1 L\u00a070 SC Unichim Romania SRL Unirea, Jud.
