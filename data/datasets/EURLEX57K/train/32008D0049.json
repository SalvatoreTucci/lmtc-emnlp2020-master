Since the various tasks and functions of the Commission and the Member States in relation to IMI will entail different responsibilities and obligations as regards data protection rules, it is necessary to define their respective functions, responsibilities and access rights.\n(6) The opinion of the Article 29 Working Party on data protection issues related to the Internal Market Information System (IMI)\u00a0(5) expressly calls for a Commission Decision which determines the rights and obligations of the IMI actors.\n(7) The exchange of information by electronic means between Member States should comply with the rules on the protection of personal data in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(6) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(7).\n(8) For the purpose of ensuring follow-up questions between competent authorities and for the purpose of situations in which a data subject wishes to appeal against a negative administrative decision taken on the basis of an information exchange, all personal data exchanged between competent authorities and processed in IMI should be retained for six months after the formal closure of an information exchange.
