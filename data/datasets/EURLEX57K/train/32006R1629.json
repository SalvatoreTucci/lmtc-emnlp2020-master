The payment deadline should therefore be extended by several months.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1010/2006 should therefore be amended.\n(5) Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 and Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 providing for the adoption of the measures concerned have been in force since 11 May 2006.
