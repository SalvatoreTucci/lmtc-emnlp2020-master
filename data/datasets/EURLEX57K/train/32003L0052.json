In addition to their shape and size, the chemical and physical properties of konjac are the cause for jelly mini-cups to constitute a serious risk to human health.\n(5) In the present case, warning through labelling is not sufficient to protect human health, especially with regard to children.\n(6) It is necessary to modify the conditions of use for E 425 konjac as regards its use in jelly confectionery, including jelly-mini cups.\n(7) Directive 95/2/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Annex IV to Directive 95/2/EC in the row for E 425: Konjac: (i) Konjac gum (ii) Konjac glucomannane the text \"Foodstuffs in general (except those referred to in Article 2(3))\" shall be replaced by the text \"Foodstuffs in general (except those referred to in Article 2(3) and jelly confectionery including jelly-mini-cups)\".", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 17 January 2004.
