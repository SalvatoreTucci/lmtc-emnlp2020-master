The aim of the programme is to estimate the baseline prevalence both in primary production and in the food chain, and to progressively reinforce implementation of hygienic measures in farms with a view to lowering the prevalence at farm level and subsequently along the food chain. The programme was approved by the Commission and Community financial assistance afforded to it for an appropriate period of time within a maximum of four years, to cover certain costs incurred by Sweden and to collect valuable technical and scientific information. The programme started from 1 July 2001.\n(3) For budgetary reasons, Community assistance is decided each year. By Commission Decisions 2001/29/EC\u00a0(2), 2001/866/EC\u00a0(3), 2002/989/EC\u00a0(4) and 2003/864/EC\u00a0(5), the Community provided financial assistance respectively for the second semester of the year 2001 and for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004.\n(4) The Swedish authorities presented on 28 May 2004 a programme for Community financial assistance during 2005, and a revised programme on 2 and 17 November 2004. On this basis, it appears appropriate to extend by six months the total period for financial assistance by the Community beyond the initially agreed total period of four years, thus providing assistance for the period 1 January to 31 December 2005. The financial assistance provided by the Community for this period should be fixed up to a maximum of EUR\u00a0160\u00a0000.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999\u00a0(6), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; for financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(6) A financial contribution from the Community shall be granted in so far as the actions provided for are effectively carried out and provided that the authorities furnish all the necessary information within the time limits provided for.\n(7) There is a need to clarify the rate to be used for the conversion of the payment applications submitted in national currency as defined in Article 1(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro\u00a0(7).\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The surveillance programme for campylobacter in broilers presented by Sweden is hereby approved for a period of 12 months starting from 1 January 2005.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial assistance from the Community for the programme referred to in paragraph 1 shall be 50\u00a0% of the costs (VAT excluded) incurred by Sweden for laboratory testing, up to SEK\u00a0165 per bacteriological test for the detection of campylobacter, SEK\u00a0330 per test for the enumeration of campylobacter and SEK\u00a0330 for the fingerprinting of campylobacter and up to a maximum of EUR\u00a0160\u00a0000.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial assistance referred to under Article 1(2) shall be granted to Sweden provided that the implementation of the programme shall be in conformity with the relevant provisions of Community law, including rules on competition and on the award of public contracts and subject to the conditions provided for in points (a) to (e):\n(a) bringing into force by 1 January 2005 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions for implementing the programme,\n(b) forwarding an intermediate financial and technical evaluation covering the first five months of the programme, at the latest four weeks after the end of the reporting period.
