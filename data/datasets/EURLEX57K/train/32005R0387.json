For the sake of clarity and international transparency, account should be taken of such amendments in Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/97\u00a0(2).\n(2) Maturity and development of avocados can be assessed by their dry matter contents. In order to exclude fruit unable to ripen, a requirement as to the minimum dry matter content should be introduced.\n(3) Trade in small-sized Hass avocados is growing and meets the demand of certain consumers.
