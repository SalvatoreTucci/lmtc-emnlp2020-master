These flavouring substances were\u00a0assessed by EFSA in the following flavouring group evaluations: evaluation FGE.21rev4\u00a0(3) (substances FL-no\u00a015.054, 15.055, 15.086 and 15.135), evaluation FGE.24rev2\u00a0(4) (substance 14.085), evaluation FGE.77rev1\u00a0(5) (substance FL-no 14.041), and evaluation FGE.93rev1\u00a0(6) (substances FL-no 15.010 and\u00a0FL-15.128). EFSA concluded that these flavouring substances do not give rise to safety concerns at the estimated levels of dietary intake.\n(4) As part of its evaluation, the Authority has made comments on the specification of certain substances. The comments are related to names, purity or composition of the following substances: FL-no: 15.054 and 15.055. These comments should be introduced in the list.\n(5) The flavouring substances assessed in these flavouring group evaluations should be listed as evaluated substances by deleting footnote references 2, 3 or 4 in the relevant entries of the Union list.\n(6) Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a034.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013;11(11):3451.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013;11(11):3453.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014;12(2):3586.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013;11(11):3452.\nANNEX\nPart A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) The entry concerning FL-no 14.041 is replaced by the following:\n\u201814.041 Pyrrole 109-97-7 1314 2318    JECFA/EFSA\u2019\n(2) The entry concerning FL-no 14.085 is replaced by the following:\n\u201814.085 2-Acetyl-5-methylpyrrole 6982-72-5      EFSA\u2019\n(3) The entry concerning FL-no 15.010 is replaced by the following:\n\u201815.010 2-Acetyl-2-thiazoline 29926-41-8 1759 2335    EFSA\u2019\n(4) The entry concerning FL-no 15.054 is replaced by the following:\n\u201815.054 Dihydro-2,4,6-triethyl-1,3,5(4H)-dithiazine 54717-17-8   Mixture of diastereoisomers ((R/R), (R/S), (S/R) & (S/S))   EFSA\u2019\n(5) The entry concerning FL-no 15.055 is replaced by the following:\n\u201815.055 [2S-(2a,4a,8ab)] 2,4-Dimethyl(4H)pyrrolidino[1,2e]- 1,3,5-dithiazine 116505-60-3 1763     EFSA\u2019\n(6) The entry concerning FL-no 15.086 is replaced by the following:\n\u201815.086 2-Methyl-2-thiazoline 2346-00-1      EFSA\u2019\n(7) The entry concerning FL-no 15.128 is replaced by the following:\n\u201815.128 2-Propionyl-2-thiazoline 29926-42-9 1760     EFSA\u2019\n(8) The entry concerning FL-no 15.135 is replaced by the following:\n\u201815.135 Ethyl thialdine 54717-14-5   At least 90 %, secondary components less than 5 % 3,5- diethyl-1,2,4-trithiolane, less than 2 % thialdine, less than 3 % other impurities   EFSA\u2019"}
