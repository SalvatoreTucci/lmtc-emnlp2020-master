This simplification will allow reducing the response burden on the parties responsible for providing statistical information, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. The coverage rate for arrivals should, therefore, be reduced from 95\u00a0% to 93\u00a0%.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1982/2004 of 18 November 2004 implementing Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States and repealing Commission Regulations (EC) No 1901/2000 and (EEC) No 3590/92\u00a0(2) lays down the arrangements for the collection of Intrastat information.
