Those vessels are included on a list communicated to the Commission in line with the requirements of Article 13(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(5) The management plan guarantees no future increase in the fishing effort, as fishing authorisations will be issued only to specified 12 vessels involving a total effort of 178 gross tonnes that are already authorised to fish by Slovenia.\n(6) Slovenia provided up-to-date scientific and technical justifications for the derogation.\n(7) The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) assessed the derogation requested by Slovenia and the related draft management plan at its plenary session held from 8 to 12 April 2013.\n(8) The derogation requested by Slovenia complies with the conditions laid down in Article 13(5) and (9) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(9) In particular, there are specific geographical constraints, as the territorial waters of Slovenia do not at any point reach a depth of 50 meters. Bottom trawlers, including the \u2018volantina\u2019 trawlers, therefore currently operate exclusively beyond 3 nautical miles, where fishing grounds are significantly limited by an area devoted to commercial shipping routes.\n(10) The \u2018volantina\u2019 trawl fishery cannot be undertaken with other gears, has no significant impact on marine environment, including protected habitats, and does not interfere with gears other than trawls, seines or similar towed nets.\n(11) The derogation requested by Slovenia affects a limited number of only 12 vessels. The registration numbers of these vessels are specified in the management plan.\n(12) The fishing activities concerned fulfil the requirements of Article 4, Article 8(1)(h) and Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006. The activity of \u2018volantina\u2019 trawlers is regulated in the Slovenian management plan to ensure that catches of species mentioned in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 are minimal.\n(13) \u2018Volantina\u2019 trawlers do not target cephalopods.\n(14) The Slovenian management plan includes measures for the monitoring of fishing activities, as provided for in the third subparagraph of Article 13(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 and in Article 14 and 15 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\u00a0(3).\n(15) The requested derogation should therefore be granted.\n(16) Slovenia should report to the Commission in due time and in accordance with the monitoring plan provided for in the Slovenian management plan.\n(17) A limitation in duration of the derogation should be established in order to allow prompt corrective management measures in case the report to the Commission shows a poor conservation status of the exploited stock while providing scope to improve the scientific basis for an improved management plan.\n(18) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 shall not apply in territorial waters of Slovenia, irrespective of the depth, between 1,5 and 3 nautical miles from the coast, to \u2018volantina\u2019 trawlers which are used by vessels:\n(a) bearing the registration number mentioned in the Slovenian management plan;\n(b) having a track record in the fishery of more than five years and not involving any future increase in the fishing effort deployed; and\n(c) holding a fishing authorization and operating under the management plan adopted by Slovenia in accordance with Article 19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.", "Monitoring plan and reporting\nSlovenia shall communicate to the Commission, within three years following the entry into force of this Regulation a report drawn up in accordance with the monitoring plan established in the management plan referred to in Article 1(c).", "Entry into force and period of application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply until 23 March 2017.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 36, 8.2.2007, p. 6.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Decision No 34200-2/2014/4 of 13.2.2014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 (OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1)."}
