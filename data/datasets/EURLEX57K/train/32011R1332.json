The studies concluded that with the current airborne collision avoidance system software there is a probability of a mid-air collision risk of 2,7 \u00d7 10\u20138 per flight hour. Therefore the current ACAS II version 7.0 is considered to be of an unacceptable safety risk.\n(3) It is necessary to introduce a new software version of the airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS II) to avoid mid-air collision of all aircraft flying in the airspace covered by Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n(4) To ensure the highest possible safety standards, aircraft which do not fall within the scope of the mandatory carriage requirement but were equipped with ACAS II prior to entry into force of this Regulation should install ACAS II containing the latest version of collision avoidance software.\n(5) In order to ensure that the safety benefits associated with the new software version are achieved, all aircraft need to be equipped as soon as practically possible. However, it is necessary to provide a realistic time for the aeronautical industry to adapt to this new Regulation taking into account the availability of new equipment.\n(6) The Agency prepared draft implementing rules and submitted them as an opinion to the Commission in accordance with Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Aviation Safety Agency Committee established by Article 65 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation lays down common airspace usage requirements and operating procedures for airborne collision avoidance to be fulfilled by:\n(a) operators of aircraft referred to under Article 4(1)(b) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 undertaking flights into, within or out of the Union; and\n(b) operators of aircraft referred to under Article 4(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 undertaking flights within the airspace above the territory to which the Treaty applies as well as in any other airspace where Member States apply Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2).", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS)\u2019 means an aircraft system based on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponder signals which operates independently of ground-based equipment to provide advice to the pilot on potential conflicting aircraft that are equipped with SSR transponders;\n(2) \u2018airborne collision avoidance system II (ACAS II)\u2019 means an airborne collision avoidance system which provides vertical resolution advisories in addition to traffic advisories;\n(3) \u2018resolution advisory (RA) indication\u2019 means an indication given to the flight crew recommending a manoeuvre intended to provide separation from all threats or a manoeuvre restriction intended to maintain existing separation;\n(4) \u2018traffic advisory (TA) indication\u2019 means an indication given to the flight crew that the proximity of another aircraft is a potential threat.", "Airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The aeroplanes referred to in Section I of the Annex to this Regulation shall be equipped with and operated in accordance with the rules and procedures as specified in the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that operation of aeroplanes referred to in Article 1(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 comply with the rules and procedures specified in the Annex in accordance with the conditions set out in that Article.", "Special provisions applying to operators subject to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91\u00a0(3)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By derogation from provisions OPS 1.668 and OPS 1.398 of Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91, Article 3 and the Annex to this Regulation shall apply for operators of aeroplanes referred to in Article 1(a).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any other obligation imposed on air operators by Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 as regards the approval, installation or operation of equipment shall continue to apply to ACAS II.", "Entry into force and application\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 3 and 4 shall apply as of 1 March 2012.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph 2, in the case of aircraft with an individual certificate of airworthiness issued before 1 March 2012, the provisions of Article 3 and 4 shall apply as of 1 December 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 79, 19.3.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 96, 31.3.2004, p. 20.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 373, 31.12.1991, p. 4.\nANNEX\nAirborne collision avoidance systems (ACAS) II\n(Part-ACAS)\nSection I \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ACAS II equipment\nAUR.ACAS.1005\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Performance requirement\n(1) The following turbine-powered aeroplanes shall be equipped with collision avoidance logic version 7.1 of ACAS II:\n(a) aeroplanes with a maximum certificated take-off mass exceeding 5\u00a0700\u00a0kg;
