New detailed rules should therefore be laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2148/96 as regards the procedure for the physical inspection of the stores as regards sugar.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2148/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Given that intervention in sugar commenced for the 2004/05 marketing year without detailed inventory rules having been laid down, the manner in which certain Member States have organised the storage of sugar stocks makes it excessively difficult to carry out an inventory according to the normal procedures. Transitional rules should therefore be laid down for sugar stocks from the 2004/05 and 2005/06 marketing years.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the EAGGF Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 2148/96 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 June 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 337, 4.12.1990, p. 3.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 288, 9.11.1996, p. 6.

Physical inspection:\n\u2014 verification of the presence of the bulk sugar in the selected silos, bins or storerooms,\n\u2014 reconciliation of the storekeepers records with those of the intervention agency,\n\u2014 identification of the bulk sugar,\n\u2014 monitoring of storage conditions and comparison of the storage point and of the identity of the bulk sugar with the store\u2019s records,\n\u2014 evaluation of the quantities stored by a method previously approved by the intervention agency, a detailed description of which must be lodged at its head office.\n3.
