In a further letter of 5 December 2003, Estonia indicated that it was planning to achieve the complete opening of the market provided for in Article 21(1)(c) of that Directive by 31 December 2015.\n(6) The request by Estonia is based on a credible restructuring plan for the oil shale sector extending until 31 December 2012.\n(7) Oil shale is the only real indigenous energy resource in Estonia and national production represents almost 84\u00a0% of world production. 90\u00a0% of the electricity produced in Estonia is from this solid fuel. It is therefore of great strategic importance for security of supply in Estonia.\n(8) The granting of a further derogation for the period 2009 to 2012 will guarantee security of investments in generating plants and security of supply in Estonia while allowing the serious environmental problems created by those plants to be resolved.\n(9) The request made by Estonia should be granted and Directive 2003/54/EC amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Article 26 of Directive 2003/54/EC, the following paragraph shall be added:\n\u20183.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Estonia shall be granted a temporary derogation from the application of Article 21(1)(b) and (c) until 31 December 2012.
