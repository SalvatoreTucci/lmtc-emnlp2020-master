By Commission Decisions 2009/471/EC\u00a0(3) and 2010/560/EU\u00a0(4) extension of that temporary derogation was granted. On 27 December 2010 Mauritius requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. According to the information received from Mauritius the catches of raw tuna remain unusually low even compared to the normal seasonal variations. Given that the abnormal situation since 2008 remains unchanged and because of the problem of piracy in the Indian Ocean a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2011.\n(2) On 14 August 2008 Commission Decision 2008/691/EC\u00a0(5) was adopted granting a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Seychelles with regard to preserved tuna. By Decisions 2009/471/EC and 2010/560/EU extension of that temporary derogation was granted. On 8 November 2010 Seychelles requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex for 4\u00a0000 tonnes of canned tuna. For the first time, Seychelles requested a derogation from the rules of origin for tuna loins. That request was for a quantity of 1\u00a0000 tonnes. According to the information provided by Seychelles the catches of raw tuna remain very low even compared to the normal seasonal variations. Furthermore, the threat of piracy results in a reduced number of fishing days in lucrative but high risk areas. Given that the abnormal situation since 2008 remains unchanged, a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2011.\n(3) On 18 September 2008 Commission Decision 2008/751/EC\u00a0(6) was adopted granting a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Madagascar with regard to preserved tuna and tuna loins. By Decisions 2009/471/EC and 2010/560/EU extension of that temporary derogation was granted. On 11 January 2011 Madagascar requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. On 28 January 2011 Madagascar provided additional information. According to this information sourcing of raw originating tuna remains difficult due to the problem of piracy in the Indian Ocean. Given that the abnormal situation since 2008 remains unchanged, a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2011.\n(4) Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC applied until 31 December 2010 because the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement between the Eastern and Southern Africa States on the one part and the European Community and its Member States on the other part (ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement) did not enter into force or was not provisionally applied before that date.\n(5) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 the rules of origin set out in Annex II to that Regulation and the derogations to them are to be superseded by the rules of the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement of which the entry into force or the provisional application is foreseen to take place in 2011. Whilst a derogation is still to be granted in 2011, the overall situation, including the state of ratification of the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement, will be reassessed in 2012.\n(6) It is necessary to ensure continuity of importations from the ACP countries to the Union as well as a smooth transition to the ESA-EU Interim Economic Partnership Agreement. Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC should therefore be prolonged with effect from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.\n(7) Mauritius, Seychelles and Madagascar will benefit from an automatic derogation from the rules of origin for tuna of HS heading 1604 pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Origin Protocol attached to the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement signed by them, when this Agreement enters into force or is provisionally applied. It would be inappropriate to grant by this Decision derogations in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 which exceed the annual quota granted to the ESA region under the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement. The ESA signatories to the Agreement have therefore signed a unilateral political declaration concerning the derogations for tuna granted in 2011 whereby these countries renounce to the global annual quantity of the automatic derogation for 2011 in case that the Agreement will either be provisionally applied or enter into force during that year. Consequently the quota amounts for 2011 should be set at 3\u00a0000 tonnes of preserved tuna and 600 tonnes of tuna loins for Mauritius, 3\u00a0000 tonnes of preserved tuna and 600 tonnes of tuna loins for Seychelles and 2\u00a0000 tonnes of preserved tuna and 500 tonnes of tuna loins for Madagascar.\n(8) Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 2008/603/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
