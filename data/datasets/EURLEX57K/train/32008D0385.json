The substitution for cadmium alloys in transducers is not yet feasible. Mercury-free flat panel lamps without lead are not available yet and no feasible substitutes for lead oxide are available for argon and krypton laser tubes.\n(3) Directive 2002/95/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 2002/95/EC, the Commission has consulted the relevant parties.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 January 2008.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 13.2.2003, p. 19.
