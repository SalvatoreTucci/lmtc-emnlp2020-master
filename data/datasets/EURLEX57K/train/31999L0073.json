whereas Germany acting as nominated rapporteur Member State, has submitted to the Commission on 5 February 1997 the assessment report concerned;\n(5) Whereas the submitted report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health; whereas this review has been finalised on 12 May 1999 in the format of the Commission review report for spiroxamine; whereas it may be necessary to update this report to take account of technical and scientific developments; whereas in such case the conditions for the inclusion of spiroxamine in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC will also need to be amended pursuant to Article 6(1) of that Directive;\n(6) Whereas the dossier and the information from the review have also been submitted to the Scientific Committee on Plants for opinion; whereas this Committee has given its opinion on 18 December 1998(4); whereas this Committee identified potential risks to algae, sediment - dwelling organisms and possibly plants; whereas therefore, where appropriate, risk mitigation measures must be taken; whereas for operator exposure, this Committee concluded that with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), the estimated operator exposure was acceptable; whereas therefore appropriate protective measures will need to be taken in order to ensure operator safety; whereas these conclusions are also consistent with the issues highlighted in the review carried out within the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health;\n(7) Whereas it has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a), (b) and (3) of the Directive, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined; whereas therefore it is necessary to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing the active substance concerned can be granted in accordance with the provisions of the said Directive;\n(8) Whereas after inclusion a reasonable period is necessary to permit Member States to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC on plant protection products containing spiroxamine and in particular to review, within this period, existing provisional authorisations or to grant, by the end of this period at the latest, new authorisations in accordance with the provisions of the Directive;
