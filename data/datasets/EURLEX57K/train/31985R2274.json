whereas, at present, aid should therefore be fixed for the use of concentrated grape must alone;\nWhereas implementation of the aid system requires administrative arrangements for checking both the origin of the products for which aid is given and the use to which they are put;\nWhereas, to ensure that the aid system and the checking arrangements operate properly, operators must be required to submit written applications giving the information necessary to identify the product and enable the operations to be checked;\nWhereas, so that the aid system can have an appreciable effect on the quantity of Community products used, a minimum quantity for which applications may be submitted should be fixed;\nWhereas it should also be stated that aid will be granted only for products having the minimum quality characteristics required for use for the purposes indicated in the second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 14a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79;\nWhereas Article 14a (3) of that Regulation sets criteria for fixing the aid amounts;

whereas to allow for technical losses the quantity actually used should be allowed to be up to 10 % less than that shown in the application;\nWhereas for technical reasons operators lay in their stocks a long time before manufacturing the marketed products; whereas accordingly arrangements should be made to enable advance payment of the aid to be made to operators, the competent authorities being guaranteed by appropriate security against the risk of incorrect payment; whereas the period within which advance payment is to be made and the procedure for release of the security should be specified;\nWhereas, to prevent discrimination between operators and to resolve certain uncertainties as to interpretation that may arise with regard to the representative rates to be applied under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1054/78 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1382/85 (2), it should be specified that for all operations under this Regulation the representative rate applicable should in all cases be that applying in the wine sector on 1 September 1985;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Aid shall be granted for the 1985/86 wine-growing year in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation:\n- to manufacturers, hereinafter referred to as 'manufacturers', who use concentrated grape must made entirely from grapes produced within wine-growing zones C III a) and C III b) for the manufacture in the United Kingdom and Ireland, of products falling within heading No 22.07 of the Common Customs Tariff for which, by virtue of the first subparagraph of Article 54 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, the use of composite names including the word 'wine' may be permitted by those Member States,\n- to processors, hereinafter referred to as 'processors' who use concentrated grape must made entirely from grapes produced within the Community as the main component in a range of products marketed in the United Kingdom and Ireland by the said processors, with clear instructions enabling the consumer to obtain therefrom a beverage in imitation of wine.", "1.
