Council Regulation (EC) No 670/2003 of 8 April 2003 laying down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin\u00a0(3) provides for import and export licences for ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. It should therefore be clarified that Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 also applies to the licences introduced by Regulation (EC) No 670/2003.\n(2) The current version of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 contains references to regulations repealed and replaced by other ones. For the sake of clarity, Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should therefore be updated.\n(3) The de minimis amounts laid down in Article 15(3) and the fourth subparagraph of Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 for lodging and confiscating the licence security have been set at EUR\u00a060. In view of the administrative costs involved in lodging or confiscating a security, these amounts should be increased.\n(4) Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 stipulates that where the re-importation of products under the returned-goods system is followed by the export of equivalent products falling within the same subheading of the combined nomenclature, the security on the licence or certificate used to export the products is released at the request of the parties concerned if certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is the requirement of the operator to export the equivalent products from a customs office in the Member State of re-importation and designated by that Member State. That creates additional costs for operators where the equivalent products to be exported are in a Member State other than the Member State of re-importation. This requirement should therefore be abolished.\n(5) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, which fixes the maximum quantities of agricultural products for which no import or export licence or advance-fixing certificate need be submitted pursuant to the fourth indent of Article 5(1) of that Regulation, should be updated.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2336/2003 of 30 December 2003 introducing certain detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 670/2003 laying down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol\u00a0(4) of agricultural origin requires an import licence to be presented from 27 January 2004 for the import of ethyl alcohol products of agricultural origin. Provision must therefore be made to fix from that date the maximum quantities of the products concerned for which no licence is required in accordance with the fourth indent of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of all Management Committees concerned,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
