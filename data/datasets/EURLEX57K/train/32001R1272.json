Since the conditions laid down in the abovementioned Article 27 continue to be met for that product, an intervention threshold for apples should be set for the 2001/02 marketing year.\n(3) The intervention threshold for apples should be set by reference to a percentage of average production intended for consumption fresh in the last five marketing years for which data are available. The period to be taken into account for accessing any overrun in the threshold for this product should also be determined.\n(4) Pursuant to the abovementioned Article 27, any overrun in the intervention threshold will result in a reduction in the Community withdrawal compensation in the marketing year following that in which the threshold is exceeded. The consequences of any such overrun should be determined and a reduction set in proportion to its size in terms of total production.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["1. The intervention threshold for apples for the 2001/02 marketing year shall be 495700 tonnes.\n2.
