This increase requires the calculation of the capital key weighting of each NCB that will be a member of the ESCB on 1 January 2007 by analogy with Article 29.1 and in compliance with Article 29.2 of the Statute. The ECB's expanded capital key and each NCB's capital key weighting will apply with effect from 1 January 2007.
