As there is no experience with the direct application of Union rules on organic production and labeling of organic products outside the territory of the Union, more time should be given to control bodies and control authorities wishing to request their inclusion in the list for the purpose of compliance.\n(2) In accordance with Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 has established a list of third countries whose system of production and control measures for organic production of agricultural products are recognised as equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. In the light of a new application and information received by the Commission from third countries since the last publication of the list, certain modifications should be taken into consideration and the list should be adapted accordingly.\n(3) Certain agricultural products imported from Canada are currently marketed in the Union pursuant to the transitional rules provided for in Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008. Canada submitted a request to the Commission to be included in the list provided for in Annex III to that Regulation. It submitted the information required pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of that Regulation. The examination of this information and consequent discussion with the Canadian authorities have led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing production and controls of agricultural products are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. The Commission has carried out an on-the-spot check of the rules of production and the control measures actually applied in Canada, as provided for in Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.\n(4) The Costa Rican, Indian, Israeli, Japanese and Tunisian authorities have asked the Commission to include new control and certification bodies and have provided the Commission with the necessary guarantees that they meet the preconditions laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008.\n(5) The duration of inclusion of Costa Rica and New Zealand in the list provided for in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 expires on 30 June 2011. In order to avoid trade disruption, there is a need to prolong the inclusion of Costa Rica and New Zealand. In the light of the experience, the inclusion should be prolonged for an unlimited period.\n(6) New Zealand transmitted editorial amendments to the relevant specifications provided in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 following the recent amalgamation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the New Zealand Food Safety Authority.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 4, \u201831 October 2011\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 October 2014\u2019;\n(2) Annex III is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 June 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 189, 20.7.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 334, 12.12.2008, p. 25.\nANNEX\nAnnex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) after the text relating to Australia, the following text is inserted:\n(a) live or unprocessed agricultural products and vegetative propagating material and seeds for cultivation;\n(b) processed agricultural products for use as food;\n(c) feed.\n\u2014 Atlantic Certified Organic Cooperative Limited (ACO), www.atlanticcertifiedorganic.ca\n\u2014 British Columbia Association for Regenerative Agriculture (BCARA), www.centifiedorganic.bc.ca\n\u2014 Certification Services Limited Liability Company (CCOF), www.ccof.org\n\u2014 Centre for Systems Integration (CSI), www.csi-ics.com\n\u2014 Consorzio per il Controllo dei Prodotti Biologici Societ\u00e0 a responsabilit\u00e0 limitata (CCPB SRL), www.ccpb.it\n\u2014 Control Union Certifications (CUC), www.controlunion.com\n\u2014 Ecocert Canada, www.ecocertcanada.com\n\u2014 Fraser Valley Organic Producers Association (FVOPA), www.fvopa.ca\n\u2014 Global Organic Alliance, www.goa-online.org\n\u2014 International Certification Services Incorporated (ICS), www.ics-intl.com\n\u2014 LETIS SA, www.letis.com.ar\n\u2014 Oregon Tilth Incorporated (OTCO), http://tilth.org\n\u2014 Organic Certifiers, www.organiccertifiers.com\n\u2014 Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA), www.ocia.org/\n\u2014 Organic Producers Association of Manitoba Cooperative Incorporated (OPAM), www.opam-mb.com\n\u2014 Pacific Agricultural Certification Society (PACS), www.pacscertifiedorganic.ca\n\u2014 Pro-Cert Organic Systems Ltd (Pro-Cert), www.ocpro.ca/\n\u2014 Quality Assurance International Incorporated (QAI), www.qai-inc.com\n\u2014 Quality Certification Services (QCS), www.qcsinfo.org\n\u2014 Organisme de Certification Qu\u00e9bec Vrai (OCQV), www.quebecvrai.org\n\u2014 SAI Global Certification Services Limited, www.saiglobal.com\n(2) in point 5 of the text relating to Costa Rica, the following indent is added:\n\u2018\u2014 Mayacert, www.mayacert.com\u2019;\n(3) point 7 of the text relating to Costa Rica is replaced by the following:\n(4) in point 5 of the text relating to India, the following indents are added:\n\u2018\u2014 Chhattisgarh Certification Society (CGCERT), www.cgcert.com\n\u2014 Tamil Nadu Organic Certification Department (TNOCD), www.tnocd.net\n\u2014 TUV India Pvt.
