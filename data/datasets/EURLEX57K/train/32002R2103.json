This states that the establishment in question has the necessary staff, equipment and facilities to carry out checks, that it uses methods equivalent to those referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 and that the fresh fruit and vegetables exported from South Africa to the Community must meet standards equivalent to the Community marketing standards.\n(3) The information sent by the Member States and in the possession of the Commission shows that, between 1997 and 2002, imports of fresh fruit and vegetables from South Africa presented a relatively low incidence of non-conformity with the marketing standards.\n(4) Representatives of the South African inspection services are regular participants in international efforts to agree marketing standards for fruit and vegetables in the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE). South Africa is also taking part in the Scheme for the Application of International Standards for Fruit and Vegetables under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Lastly, for a number of years the South African inspection services have taken part in various conferences and training activities organised by several Member States.\n(5) The conformity checks performed by South Africa should therefore be approved with effect from the date on which the administrative cooperation referred to in Article 7(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 is established.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["The checks on conformity to the marketing standards for fresh fruit and vegetables carried out by South Africa prior to importation into the Community shall be approved in accordance with the terms set out in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001.", "Details of the official correspondent and inspection bodies in South Africa referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 are given in Annex I to this Regulation.", "The certificates referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001, issued following the checks referred to in Article 1 of this Regulation, must be drawn up on forms in conformity with the model given in Annex II hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the date of publication in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Communities of the notice referred to in Article 7(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 relating to the establishment of administrative cooperation between the European Community and South Africa.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 84, 28.3.2002, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 156, 13.6.2001, p. 9.\n(4) OJ L 345, 29.12.2001, p. 20.\nANNEX I\nOfficial correspondent within the meaning of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001:\nNational Department of Agriculture DPHQ\nPrivate Bag X258\nPretoria 0001 South Africa Tel.: (27-12) 3196502 Fax: (27-12) 3265606 Email: smph@nda.agric.za\nInspection body within the meaning of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001:\nPPECB (Perishable Products Export Control Board) PO Box 15289 7500 Panorama, Parow South Africa Tel.: (27-21) 9301134 Fax: (27-21) 9306046 Email: ho@ppecb.com\nANNEX II\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2002324EN.001302.TIF\">"}
