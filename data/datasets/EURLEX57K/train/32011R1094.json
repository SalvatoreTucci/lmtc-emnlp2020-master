The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.\n(2) According to the information provided by the United Kingdom in respect of the period 1 January to 31 December 2010, the average ageing period for Scotch whisky in 2010 was eight years.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1113/2010 of 1 December 2010 fixing the coefficients applicable to cereals exported in the form of Scotch whisky for the period 2010/2011\u00a0(3) has exhausted its effects, as it concerns the coefficients applicable for the year 2010/2011. The coefficients for the period 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012 should therefore be fixed accordingly.\n(4) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area excludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Moreover, the Union has concluded agreements abolishing export refunds with certain third countries. Under the terms of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1670/2006, this should be taken into account in calculating the coefficients for 2011/2012,", "main_body": ["For the period 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012, the coefficients provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1670/2006 applying to cereals used in the United Kingdom for manufacturing Scotch whisky shall be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 312, 11.11.2006, p. 33.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 316, 2.12.2010, p. 2.\nANNEX\nCoefficients applicable in the United Kingdom\nPeriod of application Coefficient applicable\nto malted barley used in the production of malt whisky to cereals used in the production of grain whisky\nFrom 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012 0,296 0,229"}
