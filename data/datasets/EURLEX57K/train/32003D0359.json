Several outbreaks have also been declared since 16 April 2003 by Belgium. On 9 May 2003, the veterinary authorities of Germany informed the Commission about a strong suspicion, which was confirmed on 13 May 2003, of avian influenza in a poultry flock in the Land of North Rhine-Westphalen.\n(5) In order to avoid the spread of the infection and after evaluation of the epidemiological situation, the preventive culling of poultry at risk may be appropriate and decided by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned.\n(6) The Member States concerned took immediate action as provided for by Council Directive 92/40/EEC before the disease was officially confirmed.\n(7) For the sake of clarity and transparency, the Commission, after consultation with the authorities of the concerned Member States, has taken several Decisions reinforcing the measures taken by the Member States.\n(8) On basis of Decision 2003/214/EC of 27 March 2003 concerning protective measures in relation to avian influenza in the Netherlands(7), of Decision 2003/275/EC of 16 April 2003 concerning protection measures in relation to a strong suspicion of avian influenza in Belgium(8), and of Decision 2003/333/EC of 12 May 2003 concerning protection measures in relation to a strong suspicion of avian influenza in Germany(9), respectively, the Dutch, the Belgian and German authorities have started preventive emptying and culling of poultry in holdings and areas at risk, in order to avoid further spreading of the virus.\n(9) Directive 92/40/EEC does not apply where avian influenza is detected in other birds. However, in this case, the Member State concerned must inform the Commission of any measure it takes.\n(10) In order to protect rare poultry breeds and birds threatened with extinction, and to conserve bio-diversity, the Member States concerned may decide to carry out an emergency vaccination against avian influenza of these susceptible birds.\n(11) To this end and in the light of the evolution of the avian influenza situation in the Netherlands and Belgium, Commission Decision 2003/291/EC of 25 April 2003 laying down the requirements for the prevention of avian influenza in susceptible birds kept in zoos in Belgium and the Netherlands(10), was adopted, establishing the measures applicable in case the Member States concerned decide to carry out an emergency vaccination against avian influenza of susceptible birds.\n(12) The emergency vaccination, even though limited to special categories of animals not primarily concerned by trade, may contribute to jeopardising the avian influenza status in terms of international trade, not only for the Member State nor for the part of its territory where vaccination is carried out.\n(13) Therefore special requirements should be laid down regarding trade of the vaccinated birds, and it is appropriate to provide that essential information concerning the emergency vaccination should be specified in a programme to be submitted by the Member States concerned to the Commission and the other Member States.\n(14) The requirements in this Decision should apply to zoos as defined in Directive 1999/22/EC and also to other bodies, which may keep rare susceptible birds.\n(15) For the sake of clarity, it is appropriate to repeal Decision 2003/291/EC and to replace it by this Decision.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of this Decision the following definitions shall apply:\n- \"zoo\": an establishment as referred to in Article 2 of Council Directive 1999/22/EC,\n- \"approved body, institute or centre\": as referred to in Article 2(1)(c) of Council Directive 92/65/EEC,\n- \"susceptible bird\": any bird species likely susceptible to avian influenza, kept in a zoo or an approved body, institute or centre.", "The competent veterinary authorities of the Member States listed in Annex I, shall ensure that stringent bio-security measures are taken in zoos and approved bodies, institutes or centres, where susceptible birds are kept, in order to avoid risky contacts that may cause the introduction and spread of avian influenza.
