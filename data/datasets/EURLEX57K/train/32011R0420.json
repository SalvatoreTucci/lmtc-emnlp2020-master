For crabs and crab-like crustaceans, the maximum level applies to the appendages only. This definition excludes other parts of crustaceans, such as the cephalothorax of crabs and inedible parts (shell, tail). The cephalothorax comprises the digestive organs (hepatopancreas) which are known to contain high levels of cadmium. As in some Member States consumers may eat parts of the cephalothorax on a regular basis, consumer advice at a Member State level to limit consumption of these parts may be appropriate to reduce exposure to cadmium. An Information Note on this issue has been made available on the website of the Health and Consumers Directorate General of the European Commission\u00a0(3).\n(3) For reasons of consistency the portion of crustaceans to which the maximum levels apply should be modified for other contaminants (lead, mercury, dioxins and PCBs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) accordingly.\n(4) Bivalve molluscs such as green shell mussels and oysters can accumulate cadmium similarly to seaweed. Since green shell mussel powder and oyster powder, like dried seaweed, are sold as food supplements, the maximum level for cadmium in dried bivalve mollusc should be the same as the one currently established for dried seaweed and products derived from seaweed.\n(5) The provisions for leafy brassica should be aligned with those of other leaf vegetables. Leafy brassica should therefore be excluded from the default maximum level for cadmium in \u2018vegetables and fruit\u2019 in point 3.2.15 and should be included in point 3.2.17.\n(6) The default maximum levels for lead and cadmium in fruit and vegetables are not realistic for seaweed, which can naturally contain higher levels. Seaweed should therefore be exempted from the default maximum levels for lead and cadmium in fruit and vegetables (points 3.1.10 and 3.2.15). More occurrence data should be collected to decide about the need for specific more realistic maximum levels for lead and cadmium in seaweed.\n(7) Some inconsistencies exist with regard to the names of the foodstuffs/product groups in Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 and the names of the foodstuffs/product groups listed in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC\u00a0(4). Since Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 refers to the product groups listed in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 these names should be aligned to that Regulation.\n(8) It is appropriate to update the provisions on monitoring and reporting taking into account recent monitoring recommendations on ethylcarbamate\u00a0(5), perfluoroalkylated substances\u00a0(6), and acrylamide\u00a0(7). Since Commission Decision 2006/504/EC\u00a0(8) has been repealed and replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1152/2009\u00a0(9), the reference to Decision 2006/504/EC should be replaced by a reference to Regulation (EC) No 1152/2009. Furthermore, it should be clarified which data is reported to the Commission and which to EFSA.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 9 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following:\n(b) the following paragraph 4 is added:\n(2) the Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 April 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 13.2.1993, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 364, 20.12.2006, p. 5.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/contaminants/cadmium_en.htm\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 70, 16.3.2005, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 52, 3.3.2010, p. 53.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 68, 18.3.2010, p. 22.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 137, 3.6.2010, p. 4.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 199, 21.7.2006, p. 21.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 313, 28.11.2009, p. 40.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 313, 28.11.2009, p. 40.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 88, 29.3.2007, p. 56.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 52, 3.3.2010, p. 53.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 68, 18.3.2010, p. 22.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 137, 3.6.2010, p. 4.\u2019;\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Section 3.1 on lead, points 3.1.6, 3.1.9, 3.1.10 and 3.1.11 are replaced by the following:\nFoodstuffs\u00a0(1) Maximum levels (mg/kg wet weight)\n\u20183.1.6 Crustaceans\u00a0(26): muscle meat from appendages and abdomen\u00a0(44).
