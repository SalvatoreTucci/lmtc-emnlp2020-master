The amendments are the following: allow a first-time adopter in its separate financial statements to use as the deemed cost of an investment in a subsidiary, jointly controlled entity or associate either the fair value at the entity's date of transition to IFRSs or the previous GAAP carrying amount of the investment at that date; delete from IAS 27 the definition of the \u2018cost method\u2019, with the result that an investor is required to recognise as income in its separate financial statements all dividends received from a subsidiary, jointly controlled entity or associate, even if the dividend is paid out of pre-acquisition reserves; clarify how to determine the cost of an investment under IAS 27 when a parent company reorganises the operating structure of its group by establishing a new entity as its parent and this new parent obtains control of the original parent by issuing equity instruments in exchange for existing equity instruments of the original parent.\n(3) The consultation with the Technical Expert Group (TEG) of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) confirms that the amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 meet the technical criteria for adoption set out in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.
