GENERAL REMARKS\nThis programme relates to the whole of the Portuguese fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of Portugal.\nII. OBJECTIVES\n1. The aims of the programme are:\n(a) to reduce the overall level of the operational fishing fleet to 209 540 GRT and 541 003 kW, in accordance with II. 2 below;\n(b) to redeploy fishing activities in coastal areas towards more distant and deeper waters;\n(c) to modernize existing vessels without increasing overall fishing capacity (expressed in tonnage and engine power) in the category to which the vessels concerned belong, with the exception of the vessels specified in IV.2 below. Modernization measures must give priority to the introduction of selective fishing gear and the improvement of facilities for the on-board preservation and treatment of catches.\n2. During the period covered by the programme the operational fishing fleet, with the exception of:\n- working vessels used solely for aquaculture,\n- vessels used solely for bivalve fishing,\nmust remain within the following limits:\nTonnage\n(GRT)\n1.2.3.4,6 //  //  //  //  //  // Objective of 1986 programme (at 31. 12. 1986)   // Situation at 1. 1. 1987   // Objectives at 1.2.3.4.5.6 //  //  //  // 31. 12. 1989   // 31. 12. 1990  // 31. 12. 1991 (1)   //    //   //   //   //   //   //   //  //   //   //   //   // 1.

PLANNED MEASURES\n1.1. Whereas the objectives specified at II. 2 \"Total A\" require fishing capacity to be reduced by the difference between the situation at 1 January 1987 and the target to be achieved by 31 December 1991, account must also be taken of changes in fishing capacity resulting from:\n- projects for new construction which have qualified for Community and national aid in respect of 1987 and 1988,\n- applications for Community financing of projects for new construction currently under consideration by the Commission,\n- vessels joining or leaving the fleet between 1 January 1987 and 30 June 1988, if not covered by the first two subparagraphs,\nwhich, when added, give the overall fishing capacity to be reduced.\n1.2. The reduction referred to in III.1.1 above must be achieved by the following measures, the implementation of which is conditional on the fishing capacities used remaining within the limits laid down in the programme, although the reduction achieved by each measure may be varied provided that the overall fishing capacity defined in III.1.1 is reduced as planned: - a reduction in the total fleet by renewal of operational vessels which have been damaged or lost at sea, in particular by the withdrawal of operational units directly linked with new vessels and, where necessary, by the additional withdrawal of entire units, in line with the guidelines and objectives laid down at II. 2,\n- the adoption and implementation of measures to adjust fishing capacity, such as the granting of the final cessation premiums as compensation for any necessary reductions which cannot be achieved by the methods referred to in the first subparagraph,\n- other measures which enable the same results to be achieved.\n2. Adoption and implementation of legislative and/or administrative measures designed to ensure effective control of fishing capacity and fishing activities with a view to achieving the programme's objectives.\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels, with a view to effective control of fishing capacity.\n4. Redeployment of the capacity represented by vessels used for local or coastal fishing, measuring less than 9 metres between perpendiculars and registered on the mainland.\n5. Redeployment of coastal fishing vessels measuring over 9 metres between perpendiculars and registered on the mainland, by the withdrawal of obsolete or unsuitable vessels and by encouraging the use of more selective fishing techniques.\n6. Redistribution of the fleets registered in the Azores and Madeira to the benefit of units fishing for:\n- sedentary species in Azorean or Madeiran waters,\n- highly migratory species found in waters under Portuguese sovereignty.\nIV. COMMENTS\n1. The overall objective referred to in II. 1 (a) may be revised only on the basis of detailed scientific assessments showing the existence of stocks which are not fully exploited at present. In the light of experimental fishing, this figure will be adjusted before the end of 1990 up to a maximum limit of 7 000 GRT, with priority being given to the fleets operating from the Azores and Madeira.\n2. With regard to fishing vessels operation in coastal waters and measuring less than 12 metres between perpendiculars, consideration may be given to a limited increase in tonnage (up to 10 %) and engine power (up to 6 %) in order to improve safety, working conditions and on-board preserving facilities, provided that such increase is justified and that the objectives laid down in II. 2 for the category to which the vessels belong are attained. Such an increase, when it occurs, must be compatible with the resources which may be fished by the vessels concerned.\n3. The Commission would point out that all aids granted by Portugal in the fisheries sector, including those for the construction of fishing vessels, must henceforth come within the scope of this programme.'"}
