These programmes specify the objectives to be achieved, the measures carried out, their duration and their cost. Belgium and Germany have applied for the allocation of a Community financial contribution to these programmes within the time limit set out in Directive 2000/29/EC and in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 of 14 June 2002 establishing detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions relating to the allocation of a financial contribution from the Community for plant-health control and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2051/97\u00a0(2).\n(3) The technical information provided for by Belgium and Germany has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively and to conclude that the conditions for the granting of a Community financial contribution, as laid down in particular in Article 23 of Directive 2000/29/EC, have been met. Accordingly, it is appropriate to provide a Community financial contribution to cover the expenditure on these programmes.\n(4) The Community financial contribution may cover up to 50\u00a0% of eligible expenditure. However, in accordance with Article 23(5) third paragraph of the Directive, the rate of the Community financial contribution for the programme presented by Belgium should be reduced as the programme notified by this Member State has already been the subject of Community funding under Commission Decision 2004/772/EC\u00a0(3) and 2005/789/EC\u00a0(4).\n(5) In accordance with Article 24 of Directive 2000/29/EC the Commission shall ascertain whether the introduction of the relevant harmful organism has been caused by inadequate examinations or inspections and adopt the measures required by the findings from its verification.\n(6) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(5), plant-health measures are to be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.
