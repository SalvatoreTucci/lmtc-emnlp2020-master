The holdings with an economic size smaller than 4 ESU (435\u00a0307 holdings) represent only 4,04\u00a0% of total standard gross margin. The most relevant part of agricultural activity can therefore be covered with a threshold excluding the smaller holdings. The threshold set at 2 ESU should consequently be raised to 4 ESU.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 2\nFor the 2008 accounting year (a period of 12 consecutive months beginning between 1 January 2008 and 1 July 2008) and for subsequent accounting years, the threshold as referred to in Article 4 of Regulation 79/65/EEC in ESU shall be as follows:\n\u2014 Belgium: 16 ESU\n\u2014 Bulgaria: 1 ESU\n\u2014 Czech Republic: 4 ESU\n\u2014 Denmark: 8 ESU\n\u2014 Germany: 16 ESU\n\u2014 Estonia: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Ireland: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Greece: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Spain: 4 ESU\n\u2014 France: 8 ESU\n\u2014 Italy: 4 ESU\n\u2014 Cyprus: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Latvia: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Lithuania: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Luxembourg: 8 ESU\n\u2014 Hungary: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Malta: 8 ESU\n\u2014 Netherlands: 16 ESU\n\u2014 Austria: 8 ESU\n\u2014 Poland: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Portugal: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Romania: 1 ESU\n\u2014 Slovenia: 2 ESU\n\u2014 Slovakia: 8 ESU\n\u2014 Finland: 8 ESU\n\u2014 Sweden: 8 ESU\n\u2014 United Kingdom (with the exception of Northern Ireland): 16 ESU\n\u2014 United Kingdom (only Northern Ireland): 8 ESU.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the 2008 accounting year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 109, 23.6.1965, p.\u00a01859/65.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0205, 13.7.1982, p.\u00a05."}
