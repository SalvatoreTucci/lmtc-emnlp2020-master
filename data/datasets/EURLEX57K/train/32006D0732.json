First, the specifications set out in clauses 5.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2 of the standard on preventing access to the cutting blade from the feed side and from above are not sufficient to avoid contact with the blade. It is possible to remove jammed cuttings whilst the appliance is running and for the hand to come into contact with the cutting blade in doing so. Second, the specifications set out in clause 5.2.2 of the standard on preventing access to the cutting blade from the discharge chute from below are not sufficient. The dimensions of the discharge chute are such that an adult hand could come into contact with the cutting blade.\n(4) The references of standard EN 13683:2003 should therefore not be published in the Official Journal of the European Union,", "main_body": ["The references of standard EN 13683:2003 \u2018Garden equipment \u2014 Integrally powered shredders/chippers \u2014 Safety\u2019 shall not be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 207, 23.7.1998, p. 1.
