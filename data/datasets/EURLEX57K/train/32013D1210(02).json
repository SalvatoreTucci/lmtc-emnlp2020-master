By Commission Decision 2010/206/EU\u00a0(2) the permanent members of the group have been appointed and the pool list has been drawn up for a period of application of that Decision ending on 31 December 2013.\n(2) Technical advice on organic production has an important role to play in the light of the evolution of the organic sector. It is also necessary to ensure continuity in relation to the work of the group. The application of Decision 2010/206/EU should therefore be extended and the mandate of the permanent members should be renewed for a second three-year term.\n(3) In accordance with Decision 2009/427/EC, it is necessary to fix a three-year period for the mandate of the permanent members and the period of application of this Decision. However, substance and practices authorisation procedure, including technical advice, will need to be adapted to forthcoming legislative developments relating to the organic production, if necessary within short time limits. The permanent members of the group should therefore be prepared for a possible review of their mandate in the light of the on-going review of the organic legislation.\n(4) Due to the resignations of three permanent members of the group, it is appropriate to appoint three experts from the pool list in Annex II to Decision 2010/206/EU as permanent members. The lists in Annex I and Annex II to that Decision should therefore be updated.\n(5) Decision 2010/206/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2010/206/EU is amended as follows:\n1.
