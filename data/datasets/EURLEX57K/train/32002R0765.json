For agricultural products, the arrangements governing the system are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(6).\n(2) Sector 5 of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 488/2002(8), provides, inter alia, that refunds are to be granted on certain boneless cuts on condition they have a minimum lean bovine meat content and, in the case of cuts of adult male bovine animals, are individually wrapped.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2221/95(9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2655/1999(10), lays down detailed rules as regards physical checks carried out at the time of export of agricultural products qualifying for refunds. Special conditions regarding beef are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2457/97 of 10 December 1997 on the collection of samples in connection with physical checks of boneless beef cuts qualifying for export refunds(11).\n(4) Provision should be made for checks on the provenance/origin of boneless cuts of adult male bovine animals and the methodology to be applied for those checks, with a view to standardisation, and to setting appropriate penalties in the event of failure to comply with the condition regarding provenance/origin. Regulation (EC) No 2457/97 should, in addition, be updated in order to take account of changes to the nomenclature applicable to export refunds on agricultural products provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2556/2001(12).\n(5) In the interests of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 2457/97 should therefore be repealed and replaced.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1. This Regulation shall apply in the event of physical checks on the nature and characteristics of products within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 regarding:\n(a) compliance with the obligation on the individual wrapping of boneless cuts covered by the following product codes:\n- 0201 30 00 91/00,\n- 0201 30 00 91/20;\n(b) the origin of boneless cuts of adult male bovine animals covered by the following product codes:\n- 0201 30 00 91/00,\n- 0201 30 00 91/20;\n(c) the minimum average lean meat content of boneless cuts covered by the following product codes:\n- 0201 30 00 91/00,\n- 0201 30 00 91/20,\n- 0201 30 00 90/60,\n- 0202 30 90 92/00.\n2.

Sampling and sub-sampling\nThe sub-sample shall be dissected from a core part (inside) of the provided meat piece, by using a sterile(1) knife (scalpel or similar). This sample shall then be ground by using a micro grinder or cut into smaller pieces to assure for a reasonable extraction efficiency.\nSamples have to be prepared in a different working place than the one used to perform PCR. The handling of material has to be performed in an environment which can be cleaned easily, preferably on a clean bench, to ensure that no cross contamination with other samples occurs.\nSterile(2) blades, scalpels or similar tools are to be used for preparation of the meat sample.\n2. Extraction and purification of DNA\nDNA extraction and purification has to be accomplished by either using conventional procedures(3), ready-to-use kits (based on the principle: solubilisation of the meat sample in lysis buffer which contain surfactants, detergents and proteinase K, application of the solubilised sample to a DNA-binding resin, removal of non-DNA compounds by repeated washing steps, and finally elution of purified DNA in water or low-salt buffer), or extracting the DNA in sodium hydroxide solution(4).\nThe control of the successful extraction by gel electrophoresis is recommended, but not mandatory.\nValidation aspect: for each batch of samples to be extracted, one extraction control (i.e. no meat) shall be performed in parallel to prove the integrity of the applied procedure.\n3. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nPrinciple: the principle of PCR is a three-step procedure (denaturation, annealing of primers, extension) which has to be repeated for some 25 to 40 times (number of \"cycles\" in the method). The reagents (reaction buffer, MgCl2, deoxynucleotides, primers, heat-stable DNA-polymerase, sterile water) are mixed together according to the developed method, leading the \"mastermix\". Dedicated pipettes shall be used for the preparation of the mastermix. This mastermix is then added to the DNA template (extracted DNA). The reaction is performed in a thermo-cycler. After completion, the PCR products are analysed by gel electrophoresis or stored at 4 \u00b0C or at - 20 \u00b0C.\nThe recommended(5) method to be applied, referring to the template, has to either amplify a sequence within the amelogenin locus (homologous gene) or within the ZFX/Y region (allele-specific PCR).\nSpecific primers for these two types of methods are:\nAmelogenin forward: 5'-CAGCCAAACCTCCCTCTGC-3'\nAmelogenin reverse: 5'-CCCGCTTGGTCTTGTCTGTTGC-3'\n(Ennis, S., and Gallagher, T.F. (1994) Anim. Genet. 25: 425-427)\nAmelogenin forward: 5'-AAATTCTCTCACAGTCCAAG-3'\nAmelogenin reverse: 5'-CAACAGGTAATTTTCCTTTAG-3'\n(Chen, C.M., Hu, C.L., Wang, C.H., Hung, C.M., Wu, H.K., Choo, K.B., and Cheng, W.T.K. (1999) Mol. Reprod. Dev. 54, 209-214)\nZFX (allele-specific), forward: 5'-GACAGCTGAACAAGTGTTACTG-3'\nZFX (allele-specific), reverse: 5'-AATGTCACACTTGAATCGCATC-3'\nZFY (allele-specific), forward: 5'-GAAGGCCTTCGAATGTGATAAC-3'\nZFY (allele-specific), reverse: 5'-CTGACAAAAGGTGGCGATTTCA-3'\n(Kirkpatrick, B.W., and Monson, R.L.

(1995) Theriogenology 43: 265)\nPCR mastermixes have to be prepared on a clean bench, which is decontaminated after work using detergents and UV light.\n- Method development: possible alterations to published methods might be required, such as the exact mastermix composition (e.g. MgCl2 concentration, primer concentration), the amount of template DNA used, and an adapted temperature program (temperatures, holding times). The appearance of non-specific amplification products shall lead to optimisation (e.g. annealing temperature, MgCl2 concentration, primer concentrations etc.) to guarantee the accuracy of the results.\n- Validation aspects: the method to be applied in routine analysis has to be properly validated. The analysis of the following controls has to be included in a set of samples: extraction control (no meat), negative PCR control, and reference samples (male and female beef but also one sample of meat other than beef). Moreover, revalidation shall be applied if key components in the procedure are changed, such as DNA polymerase (different supplier or product) or primers (new lot).\n- Good laboratory practice is deemed indispensable such as proper cleaning and decontamination of the working place and instruments used, aliquoting of primers, dedicated use of pipettes etc.\n4. Analysis of amplicons by gel electrophoresis\nThe PCR fragments (amplicons) obtained are to be analysed by gel electrophoresis. Either agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide or polyacrylamide gels which are silver stained after completion of the electrophoretic separation are applicable. An appropriate molecular weight marker on the gel to determine the approximate size of the obtained amplicons has to be used.\n5. Documentation\nThe obtained results have to be properly documented (gel image, description of results, noting of any non-expected result).\n(1) Not contaminated with DNA.\n(2) Not contaminated with DNA.\n(3) As described in: Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F., and Maniatis, T.
