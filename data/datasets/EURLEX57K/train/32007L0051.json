Such trade is limited in extent and seems to pose no risk to human health or the environment, and should therefore not be restricted.\n(5) At present, mercury barometers are manufactured by only a few small specialist enterprises and are sold to the general public mainly as decorative items. An additional phasing-out period should be provided for the placing on the market of such barometers so as to allow the manufacturers to adapt their business in line with the restrictions and move over to the production of mercury-free barometers.\n(6) With the aim of minimising the release of mercury into the environment and in order to ensure the phasing-out of the remaining measuring devices containing mercury in professional and industrial use, especially sphygmomanometers in healthcare, the Commission should carry out a review of the availability of reliable safer alternatives that are technically and economically feasible. In the case of sphygmomanometers in healthcare, medical experts should be consulted to ensure that the needs, in terms of diagnosis and treatment, of specific medical conditions are adequately addressed.\n(7) In accordance with this Directive only the placing on the market of new measuring devices should be restricted. This restriction should therefore not apply to devices that are already in use or sold second hand.\n(8) The disparities between the laws or administrative measures adopted by Member States as regards restriction on mercury in various measuring and control devices could create barriers to trade, distort competition in the Community and may thereby have a direct impact on the establishment and functioning of the internal market. It therefore appears necessary to approximate the laws of Member States in the field of measuring and control devices by introducing harmonised provisions with regard to those products containing mercury, thus preserving the internal market whilst ensuring a high level of protection for human health and the environment.\n(9) Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations\u00a0(4) should be amended accordingly.\n(10) This Directive should apply without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers contained in Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(5) and individual directives based thereon, in particular Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work\u00a0(6).\n(11) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making\u00a0(7), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, no later than 3 October 2008, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
