If there is no reference price fixed for the fresh product, the reference prices are determined on the basis of the reference price applied to a commercially similar fresh product. However, given the quantities of certain frozen and salted products and the conditions governing their importation, it does not appear possible to fix a reference price for all of these products in the immediate future.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for fishery products,", "main_body": ["The reference prices for the 2000 fishing year for the products specified in Annexes I, II, III and IV(A) and (B) and some products in Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 shall be as shown in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2000.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 1999.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 388, 31.12.1992, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 350, 31.12.1994, p. 15.\n(3) See page 38 of this Official Journal.\n(4) OJ L 197, 6.8.1993, p. 8.\n(5) OJ L 85, 19.4.1995, p. 13.\nANNEX\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999340EN.005802.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999340EN.005901.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999340EN.006001.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999340EN.006101.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999340EN.006201.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999340EN.006301.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999340EN.006401.EPS\">"}
