A number of Member States have notified to the Commission their wish to adopt such provisions. Those provisions have been examined by the Commission which has concluded that the relevant conditions are met. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the adoption of those provisions.\n(2) Pursuant to Directive 96/49/EC, Member States may authorise the regular transport on particular designated routes within their territory of dangerous goods, forming part of a defined industrial process, which are either prohibited by the provisions of the Annex to that Directive or are performed under conditions different from those set out in that Annex, where such operations are of a local nature and are tightly controlled under clearly specified conditions. A number of Member States have notified to the Commission their wish to adopt provisions authorising such regular transport. The Commission has concluded that the requirements for such authorisation are met. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the Member States concerned to adopt such provisions.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on transport of dangerous goods, set up by Article 9 of Directive 94/55/EC,", "main_body": ["Member States listed in Annex I are authorised to adopt, with regard to the transport by rail within their

Any variation will have a quantity limitation on one or more constituent parts of the load and would only be permitted provided that \"all reasonably practicable measures have been taken to prevent the explosives being brought into contact with, or otherwise endangering or being endangered by, any such goods\".\nExamples of variations the United Kingdom may want to permit are:\n1. explosives allocated on classification to UN No 0029, 0030, 0042, 0065, 0081, 0082, 0104, 0241, 0255, 0267, 0283, 0289, 0290, 0331, 0332, 0360, or 0361 may be carried in the same vehicle with the dangerous goods allocated on classification the UN No 1942.

For the purpose of calculating mixed loads, the multiplication factors will read \"20\" for transport category 2 and \"2\" for transport category 3.\nANNEX II\nDEROGATIONS FOR MEMBER STATES ON LOCAL TRANSPORT LIMITED TO THEIR TERRITORY\nSWEDEN\nRA-LT 14.1\nSubject: carriage of hazardous waste to hazardous waste disposal plants\nReference to the Annex to the Directive: part 2, classes 5.2 and 6.1\nContent of the Annex to the Directive: classification, marking and labelling, and requirements for the construction and testing of packaging\nReference to national legislation: S\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om vissa inrikes transporter av farligt gods p\u00e5 v\u00e4g och i terr\u00e4ng\nContent of the national legislation: the legislation consists of simplified classification criteria, less restrictive requirements for the construction and testing of packaging, and modified labelling and marking requirements. Instead of classifying hazardous waste according to RID it is assigned to different waste groups. Each waste group contains substances that can, in accordance with RID, be packed together (mixed packing). Each package must be marked with the relevant waste group code instead of the UN number.\nComments: these regulations may only be used for the carriage of hazardous waste from public recycling sites to hazardous waste-disposal plants."}
