It is also specified that the PGI can be used in describing, presenting and promoting foodstuffs containing, as an improving ingredient raising their quality, Nocciola del Piemonte/Nocciola Piemonte but no other product of the same type.\n- There is a formal change in the description of the production area: its boundaries are not changed but following recognition of the new Province of Biella the list of communes has been rearranged.\nMethod of production\n- Planting density is altered from 250 to 400 to 200 to 420 bushes per hectare. Densities of up to 500 per hectare are authorised only for plantations dating from before entry into force of the Decree of recognition of 2 December 1993.\n- Annual notification by Piedmont Region of average production per hectare and the date of commencement of the harvest (to take account of factors varying from year to year) is withdrawn.\n- Plantations must be listed in a special register held by the approved inspection agency instead of in a register held by the local chamber of commerce.\n- Unshelled fruit can be sold unpackaged but only when sold for the first time, i.e. by the grower to the operator of a packaging or processing unit.\n- Packaging requirements for shelled, semi-processed and processed nuts (packaging suitable for food use) and also for nuts that have undergone processing exploiting their quality are more clearly specified. The marketed product must be prepackaged or it must be packaged at the moment of sale.\nLabelling\n- The information to be given on the labelling is more clearly indicated, as are certain labelling requirements allowing traceability to be guaranteed. In particular the information that must be given on the labelling of processed products containing Nocciola del Piemonte/Nocciola Piemonte as sole ingredient are specified.\n- For both unshelled and shelled nuts the harvest year must be shown on the label.\n- Some labelling requirements considered to be already included in the general food product labelling requirements are withdrawn.\nNational requirements\n- Reference to the national penalties applicable for infringement of the specification provisions is withdrawn, since they are applicable without any such reference.\n- Article 9 is inserted specifying rules for the inspection body's work."}
