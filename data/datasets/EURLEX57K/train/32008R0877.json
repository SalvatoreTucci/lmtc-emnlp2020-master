Under that Regulation, tenders may be submitted for the last time between 10 and 24 September 2008.\n(3) It is foreseeable that intervention stocks of sugar will continue to exist in most of the Member States concerned after expiry of that last possibility to submit tenders. In order to respond to the continued market needs, it is therefore appropriate to open a further standing invitation to tender to make these stocks available on the internal market.\n(4) To allow comparison of tender prices for sugar of different qualities, the tender price should refer to sugar of the standard quality as defined in Part B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to fix a minimum quantity per tenderer or per lot.\n(6) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a minimum selling price for each partial invitation to tender.\n(7) The minimum selling price refers to sugar of the standard quality. Provision should be made to adjust the selling price in cases where the sugar is not of this quality.\n(8) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(9) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States on the quantities actually sold.\n(10) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01262/2001\u00a0(4) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10\u00a0February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden listed in Annex I shall offer for sale by standing invitation to tender on the Community internal market a maximum total quantity of 345\u00a0539 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention and available for sale on the internal market.\nThe maximum quantities involved per Member State are set out in Annex I.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The period during which tenders may be submitted in response to the first partial invitation to tender shall begin on 1 October 2008 and shall end on 15 October 2008 at 15.00 Brussels time.\nThe periods during which tenders may be submitted in response to the second and subsequent partial invitations shall begin on the first working day following the end of the preceding period. They shall end at 15.00 Brussels time on:\n\u2014 29 October 2008,\n\u2014 12 and 26 November 2008,\n\u2014 3 and 17 December 2008,\n\u2014 7 and 28 January 2009,\n\u2014 11 and 25 February 2009,\n\u2014 11 and 25 March 2009,\n\u2014 15 and 29 April 2009,\n\u2014 13 and 27 May 2009,\n\u2014 10 and 24 June 2009,\n\u2014 1 and 15 July 2009,\n\u2014 5 and 26 August 2009,\n\u2014 9 and 23 September 2009.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tender price shall refer to white sugar and raw sugar of the standard quality as defined in Part B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The minimum quantity of the tender per lot in accordance with Article 42(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 shall be 250 tonnes unless the available quantity for that lot is less than 250 tonnes. In such cases the available quantity must be tendered.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall be lodged with the intervention agency holding the sugar as set out in Annex I to this Regulation.", "The intervention agencies concerned shall communicate to the Commission tenders submitted within two hours after the expiry of the deadline for the submissions laid down in Article 2(1).\nThe tenderers shall not be identified.\nTenders submitted shall be communicated in electronic form according to the model set out in Annex II.\nWhen no tenders are submitted, the Member State shall communicate this to the Commission within the time limit fixed in the first paragraph.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall fix per Member State concerned the minimum selling price or decide not to accept the tenders in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 195 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For intervention sugar which is not of the standard quality, Member States shall adjust the actual selling price by way of application mutatis mutandis of, respectively, Article 32(6) and Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006. In this context, the reference, in Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, to Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006\u00a0(5) shall be interpreted as a reference to Part B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where an award at a minimum price set pursuant to paragraph 1 would result in the available quantity for the Member State concerned being exceeded, that award shall be limited to such quantity as is still available.\nWhere awards for a Member State to all tenderers offering the same price would result in the quantity for that Member State being exceeded, then the quantity available shall be awarded as follows:\n(a) by division among the tenderers concerned in proportion of the total quantities in each of their tenders; or\n(b) by apportionment among the tenderers concerned by reference to a maximum tonnage fixed for each of them; or\n(c) by drawing of lots.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the fifth working day at the latest after the Commission fixes the minimum sale price, the intervention agencies involved shall communicate to the Commission, according to the model set out in Annex III, the quantity actually sold by partial invitation to tender.", "By way of derogation from the second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 shall not apply to the resale, as referred to in Article 1 of this Regulation, of sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2008. It shall expire on 31 March 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 September 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 1.7.2006, p. 39.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 242, 15.9.2007, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 48.
