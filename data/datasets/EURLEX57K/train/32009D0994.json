Twenty-seven of those establishments are allowed to receive and process compliant and non-compliant raw milk without separation. Those establishments should be included in the list of Chapter I of the Appendix to Annex VI.\n(3) One milk processing establishment is currently allowed to receive and process compliant and non-compliant raw milk without separation and is therefore listed in Chapter I of the Appendix to Annex VI. That establishment now only processes compliant raw milk and should therefore be deleted from that list.\n(4) One milk processing establishment is currently allowed to receive and process compliant and non-compliant raw milk on separate production lines and is therefore listed in Chapter II of the Appendix to Annex VI. That establishment now only processes compliant raw milk and should therefore be deleted from that list.\n(5) The Appendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Appendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 December 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\nANNEX\nThe Appendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania is amended as follows:\n1.
