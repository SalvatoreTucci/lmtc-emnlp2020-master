These provisions have been amended several times following each accession of new Member States, when new members had to be added to the Administrative Board.\n(2) The external evaluation of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (hereinafter the Foundation) carried out in 2001 underlines the need to adapt the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 in order to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the Foundation and its management structures, including a revision of the provisions concerning the Committee of Experts.\n(3) The European Parliament has called upon the Commission to reconsider the composition and working methods of agencies\u2019 boards and to put forward appropriate proposals.\n(4) A joint opinion concerning the future governance and functioning of the Boards of the Foundation, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training has been submitted to the Commission by their respective management or Administrative Boards.\n(5) The tripartite governance of the Foundation, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training by representatives of national governments, employers\u2019 organisations and employees\u2019 organisations is fundamental to the success of those bodies.\n(6) The participation of the social partners in the governance of those three Community bodies creates a specificity which requires them to function according to common rules.\n(7) The existence within the tripartite Board of the three groups drawn from government, employers and employees and the designation of a coordinator for the groups of employers and employees have proved to be essential. That arrangement should therefore be formalised and also extended to the government group.\n(8) The maintenance of the tripartite representation from each Member State ensures that all major stakeholders are involved and that account is taken of the diversity of interests and approaches which characterise social issues.\n(9) It is necessary to anticipate the practical consequences for the Foundation of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union. The composition and functioning of its Board should be adjusted to take account of the accession of new Member States.\n(10) The Bureau provided for in the Rules of Procedure of the Board needs to be strengthened in order to ensure continuity in the functioning of the Foundation and efficiency in its decision-making; the composition of the Bureau should continue to reflect the tripartite structure of the Board.\n(11) According to Article 3 of the Treaty, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities and promote equality between men and women in all its activities. Therefore, it is appropriate to make provision for encouraging a balanced representation of men and women in the composition of the Board.\n(12) The Board should be able to ensure a formal contribution of independent experts for a limited duration in accordance with specific needs in relation to the implementation of the work programme.\n(13) It is appropriate to treat the staff of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, which has been the only Community Agency with its own Staff Regulations, in the same manner as other servants engaged under contract by the Communities and to entitle them to the same benefits of the reformed Staff Regulations by respecting acquired rights, especially with respect to careers and pension rights.\n(14) Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(15) The Treaty provides for no powers other than those under Article 308 thereof, for the adoption of this Regulation,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 3, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n2.
