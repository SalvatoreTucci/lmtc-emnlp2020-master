It should also help to eliminate substandard ships and make it possible to reestablish competition between operators. Furthermore, in Resolution A.898(21), the International Maritime Organisation invited States to urge shipowners to be properly insured.\n(5) Non compliance with the provisions of this Directive should be rectified. Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on port State control (recast)\u00a0(5) already provides for the detention of ships in the case of absence of certificates which have to be carried on board. However, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility of expelling a ship which does not carry a certificate of insurance. The modalities of the expulsion should allow the situation to be rectified within a reasonable time period.\n(6) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely the introduction and implementation of appropriate measures in the field of maritime transport policy, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Directive lays down rules applicable to certain aspects of the obligations on shipowners as regards their insurance for maritime claims.", "Scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall apply to ships of 300 gross tonnage or more.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall not apply to warships, auxiliary warships or other State owned or operated ships used for a non commercial public service.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall be without prejudice to the regimes established by the instruments in force in the Member State concerned and listed in the Annex hereto.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018shipowner\u2019 means the registered owner of a seagoing ship, or any other person such as the bareboat charterer who is responsible for the operation of the ship;\n(b) \u2018insurance\u2019 means insurance with or without deductibles, and comprises, for example, indemnity insurance of the type currently provided by members of the International Group of P & I Clubs, and other effective forms of insurance (including proved self insurance) and financial security offering similar conditions of cover;\n(c) \u20181996 Convention\u2019 means the consolidated text of the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), as amended by the 1996 Protocol.", "Insurance for maritime claims\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall require that shipowners of ships flying its flag have insurance covering such ships.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall require shipowners of ships flying a flag other than its own to have insurance in place when such ships enter a port under the Member State's jurisdiction.
