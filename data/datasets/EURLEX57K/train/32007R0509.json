It shall aim at a progressive implementation of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, and shall contribute to efficient fishing activities within an economically viable and competitive fisheries industry, providing a fair standard and taking the interests of consumers into account.\n(5) In order to achieve this objective the Western Channel sole stock must be brought within safe biological limits by reducing fishing mortality rates and must be managed in such a way that the full reproductive capacity of the stock is maintained and a high long-term yield is provided for.\n(6) The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries has advised that a fishing mortality rate of 0,27 is consistent with taking a high long-term yield and achieving a low risk of depleting the productive potential of the stock.\n(7) Such control of the fishing mortality rates can be achieved by establishing an appropriate method for the establishment of the level of Total Allowable Catches (TACs), and a system whereby fishing efforts on these stocks are restricted to levels at which the TACs are unlikely to be exceeded.\n(8) Control measures in addition to those laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy\u00a0(3), need to be included in order to ensure compliance with the measures laid down in this Regulation.\n(9) During the first stage in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009, the multi-annual plan shall be deemed to be a recovery plan and subsequently a management plan within the meaning of Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nSUBJECT-MATTER AND OBJECTIVES", "Subject-matter\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation establishes a

shall decide each year by qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission on Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for Western Channel sole at that level of catches which, according to a scientific evaluation carried out by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), is the higher of:\n(a) that TAC whose application will result in a 20\u00a0% reduction in the fishing mortality rate in 2007 compared to the average fishing mortality rate in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 as most recently estimated by STECF;\n(b) that TAC whose application will result in
