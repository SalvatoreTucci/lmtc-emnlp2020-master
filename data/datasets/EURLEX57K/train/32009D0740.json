By letter of 29 June 2009, further clarification was provided in relation to this request.\n(5) France has provided sufficient technical justification for its request, based in particular on the need to keep the current RUBIS communication system fully operational and uninterrupted during the migration period and to procure and install new equipment.\n(6) The first phase of implementation will end on 1 January 2012 and make the band 2\u00a0500-2\u00a0690\u00a0MHz available in accordance with Decision 2008/477/EC in the most densely populated areas of France. The second phase will cover all areas not included in the first phase and will make them available by 31 December 2013, with the exception of Corsica, where spectrum will be made available by 31 May 2014.\n(7) Considering the envisaged duration of the migration, and in order to ensure the shortest transitional period possible, the French authorities commenced the process of migration on 1 July 2009.\n(8) A progress report on migration and implementation of commitments will help manage the transition period properly.\n(9) The members of the Radio Spectrum Committee indicated at the Committee meeting on 2 October 2008 that they did not object to this transitional derogation.\n(10) The requested derogation would not unduly defer implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC or create undue differences in the competitive or regulatory situations between Member States. The request is justified and a transitional derogation would be appropriate to facilitate the full implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC,", "main_body": ["France is hereby authorised to postpone the full implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC until 31 May 2014, subject to the conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 3.", "France shall make the band 2\u00a0500-2\u00a0690\u00a0MHz available, in accordance with Decision 2008/477/EC, in the most densely populated areas of France by 1 January 2012, including the region Ile de France, so that at least half of the French population is covered by that date.
