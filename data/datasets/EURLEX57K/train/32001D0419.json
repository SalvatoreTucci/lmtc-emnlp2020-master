A system should therefore be created at European Union level to allow for the legal transmission of such samples. Such system should apply to all forms of transmission of samples of seized controlled substances between Member States. Transmission should be based on agreement between the sending and the receiving Member State.\n(4) Transmission should take place in a manner that is secure and guarantees that the transported samples cannot be abused,", "main_body": ["Establishment of a system for the transmission of samples\n1.
