whereas furthermore, as far as bovine animals and swine are concerned, the competent authority is obliged to provide this information to the official veterinarian at the inspection post systematically, and to record certain  details of imported bovine animals and swine and to retain such details for 12 months;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 20 (b) (i) and (ii) of Directive 72/462/EEC, and Article 6 (1) of Council Directive 85/649/EEC of 31 December 1985 prohibiting the use in livestock farming of certain substances having a hormonal action (7), Member States  are required to prohibit the importation into their territory of animals or meat of animals treated with certain hormones or thyrostatic substances, or containing residues of other substances at a hazardous level;\nWhereas Article 24 of Directive 72/462/EEC requires that random sampling must be carried out to verify the presence of these substances; whereas, furthermore, as far as hormonal substances are concerned, Article 6 of Directive 85/649/EEC requires the  establishment of a programme of controls on imports from each third country, including systematic inspections in the event of positive results;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 8 of Council Directive 85/358/EEC of 16 July 1985 supplementing Directive 81/602/EEC concerning the prohibition of certain substances having a hormonal action and of any substances having a thyrostatic action (8) and Article  9 of Council Directive 86/469/EEC of 16 September 1986 concerning the examination of animals and fresh meat for the presence of residues (9), if the results of tests on animals or meat indicate the need for investigation, the Member State concerned must  notify other Member States and the Commission;\nWhereas a system to monitor fresh meat from third countries for such substances would require the application of statistical sampling methods to such meat on a Community basis;\nWhereas Article 23 of Directive 72/462/EEC requires fresh meat to be subjected to an animal health inspection, whatever the procedure under which it is declared, and prohibits importation if it is found that the meat does not come from an approved  country or establishment, or if it comes from a prohibited country, or if it is not covered by a health certificate which complies with the conditions of Article 22 of that Directive;\nWhereas such sampling routines and other requirements for the exchange of information between inspection posts, Member States and the Commission require that use be made of modern communications and data-processing technology to manage the flow of data  to ensure that the inspection procedure does not hinder the free movement of goods, by making the information freely and quickly available at all levels;\nWhereas the rapid flow of data will provide safeguards against the risk of the introduction of bovine animals, swine or fresh meat which present a hazard in respect of animal or public health, because of the situation in the country of origin, and in  particular because of false declarations which may be made;\nWhereas the use of modern technology will allow the application of extra safeguards without impeding the flow of imported goods;\nWhereas the Council adopted a resolution on the computerization of administrative procedures in intra-Community trade (10); whereas, further to that resolution, the Commission transmitted to the Council a communication on the coordinated development of  computerized administrative procedures (CD project) (11), which provides a framework for developing computerized systems for international trade extending up to 31 December 1991; whereas that Communication broadened the scope of the said resolution  since it not only established guidelines for developing national computerized systems dealing with intra-Community trade but also covered systems for external trade and the interconnection of the relevant systems of the Commission with those of the  Member States (the CD project);\nWhereas, however, the CD project does not itself take account of the special requirements of veterinary inspection services in Member States; whereas, therefore, these requirements should be examined in detail and measures introduced to ensure that the  necessary inspections and tests are carried out as efficiently and speedily as possible;\nWhereas the Commission should be responsible for implementing measures necessary for the coordinated development of computerization of these procedures; whereas these objectives are an integral part of the general framework of the CADDIA programme;  whereas it is necessary to establish an appropriate procedure which allows the Commission to adopt Community measures necessary for the implementation of the Shift project,", "main_body": ["The Commission shall be responsible for drawing up a programme for the development of computerization of veterinary importation procedures (Shift project).\nFrom the date of notification of this Decision and until the adoption of the said programme, the Member States and the Commission shall coordinate their actions with regard to any new measure to be taken in the field covered by this Decision.", "The Shift project shall be undertaken as part of the CADDIA programme in conformity with its long-term objectives of providing the necessary organizational infrastructure and data-processing facilities to enable the Commission and Member  States to obtain access to and process, expeditiously and efficiently, the information needed to achieve the objectives of such Regulations and Directives as may be or have been enacted pursuant to Directive 72/462/EEC, and in particular Articles 20,  22, 23, 24 and 28 thereof, Decision 84/390/EEC, Directives 85/649/EEC and 86/469/EEC and such other Regulations, Directives and Decisions as may be made in the field of harmonization of animal and public health rules relating to the importation of  animals and animal products from third countries.", "In order to achieve the objectives of the Shift project, the Commission shall, after obtaining the opinion of the CADDIA Steering Committee set up by Decision 85/214/EEC (12), and acting in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 4  thereof:\n- draw up a programme to coordinate action by Member States and the Commission designed to achieve the objectives set out in Article 2, taking into account the compatibility of national communication and data-processing systems from frontier posts,\n- adopt appropriate standards for the interchange of data and rules governing the security of the data exchanged.", "1.
