It provides that the competent authority in a Member State may introduce a system of surveillance networks. Those networks include a computer database which is to contain, as a minimum, a number of elements laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC, including the identification code of each animal.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) establishes a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals. It requires as a general rule that the two official means of identification allocated to an animal bear the same identification code. However, during the initial phase of adjustment to the use of electronic identifiers as an official means of identification, it could not be excluded that, in certain cases, technical limitations related to the configuration of an animal\u2019s original identification code could prevent the reproduction of that code on an electronic identifier. This could occur where the characters forming an animal\u2019s existing identification code prevent that code from being converted into an electronic format. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No\u00a01760/2000 provides for specific transitory derogations to allow the application of an electronic identifier also to those animals, provided that full traceability is ensured and that the animals can be identified individually, including the holding on which they were born. The possibility of using such electronic identifiers should be reflected in the list of elements of the computer databases laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC.\n(3) In the interest of consistency of Union legislation, the type of electronic identifier, if applied to the animals, should also be added to the list of elements to be included in the computer databases laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC.\n(4) Directive 64/432/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In part C of Article 14(3) of Directive 64/432/EEC, point (1) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(1) for each animal:\n\u2014 the unique identification code or codes, as regards the cases set out in Articles 4(1), 4b, 4c(1) and 4d of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5),\n\u2014 date of birth,\n\u2014 sex,\n\u2014 breed or colour of coat,\n\u2014 identification code of the mother or, in the case of an animal imported from a third country, the unique identification code of the individual means of identification allocated to the animal by the Member State of destination in accordance with Regulation (EC) No\u00a01760/2000,\n\u2014 identification number of the holding where born,\n\u2014 identification numbers of all holdings where the animal has been kept and the dates of each change of holding,\n\u2014 date of death or slaughter,\n\u2014 the type of electronic identifier, if applied to the animal.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By 18 January 2016, Member States shall bring into force, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
