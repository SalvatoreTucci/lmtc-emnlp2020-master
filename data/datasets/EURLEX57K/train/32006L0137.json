The conditions and technical requirements for issuing inland navigation certificates under Article 22 of the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation are updated regularly and are recognised as reflecting current technological developments.\n(3) In order to prevent distortions of competition and varying levels of safety, it is desirable, specifically in the interests of promoting harmonisation at European level, to adopt equivalent technical requirements for the whole of the Community's inland waterway network and, subsequently, to update them at regular intervals in order to maintain that equivalence.\n(4) Directive 2006/87/EC authorises the Commission to adapt those technical requirements in the light of technical progress and of developments arising from the work of other international organisations, in particular that of the CCNR.\n(5) Those amendments need to be made rapidly in order to ensure that the technical requirements necessary for the issuing of the Community inland navigation certificate give a level of safety equivalent to that required for the issuing of the certificate referred to in Article\u00a022 of the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation.\n(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of Directive 2006/87/EC should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission5\u00a0(3).\n(7) In particular the Commission should be empowered to establish the conditions under which the technical requirements and administrative procedures set out in the Annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC may be amended. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2006/87/EC, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article\u00a05a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(8) On grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of such measures amending the Annexes to Directive\u00a02006/87/EC.\n(9) On grounds of urgency, it is necessary to apply the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of any amendment of the Annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC to take account of technical developments or related developments arising from the work of other international organisations, in particular the\u00a0CCNR, as well as for the adoption of temporary requirements.\n(10) Directive 2006/87/ECshould therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Directive 2006/87/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1) The following paragraphs shall be added to Article 19:\n2) Article 20 shall be replaced by the following:\n3) Annex II shall be amended as follows:\n1) Article 1.06 shall be replaced by the following:\n2) Article 10.03a(5) shall be replaced by the following:\n3) Article\u00a010.03b(1) shall be replaced by the following:\n(a) CO2 (carbon dioxide);\n(b) HFC 227 ea (heptafluoropropane);\n(c) IG-541 (52 % nitrogen, 40 % argon, 8 % carbon dioxide).", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States which have inland waterways as referred to in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive\u00a02006/87/EC shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive with effect from 30 December 2008.
