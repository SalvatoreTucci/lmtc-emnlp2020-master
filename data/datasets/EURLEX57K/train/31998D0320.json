A temporary experiment is hereby organised at Community level with the aim of assessing whether seed sampling for the purpose of seed testing and seed testing under official supervision may constitute improved alternatives to the procedures for official seed certification required within the meaning of Directives 66/400/EEC, 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC and 69/208/EEC, without a significant decline in the quality of the seed.\nAny Member State may participate in the experiment.\n2. Member States which participate in the experiment are hereby released from the obligations laid down in the Directives referred to in paragraph 1 in respect of official seed sampling and official seed testing, subject to the conditions set out in Articles 2 and 3 respectively.", "1. Seed sampling shall be carried out by seed samplers who have been authorised for that purpose by the competent seed certification authority of the Member State concerned under the conditions set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.\n2. Seed samplers shall have the necessary technical qualifications obtained in training courses organised under conditions applicable to official seed samplers and confirmed by official examinations.\nThey shall carry out seed sampling in accordance with current international methods.\n3. Seed samplers shall be:\n(a) independent natural persons,\nor\n(b) persons employed by natural or legal persons whose activities do not involve seed production, seed growing, seed processing or seed trade,\nor\n(c) persons employed by natural or legal persons whose activities involve seed production, seed growing, seed processing or seed trade.\nIn the case referred to in point (c), a seed sampler may carry out seed sampling only on seed lots produced on behalf of his employer, unless it has been otherwise agreed between his employer, the applicant for certification and the competent seed certification authority.\n4. In respect of their responsibilities vis-\u0102\u00a0-vis the competent seed certification authority, seed samplers shall be assimilated to official seed samplers. Their performance of seed sampling shall be subject to proper supervision by the competent seed certification authority.\n5. For the purposes of the supervision referred to in paragraph 4 a proportion of the seed lots entered for the official certification under the experiment shall be check-sampled by official seed samplers. That proportion shall in principle be as evenly spread as possibly over natural and legal persons entering seed for certification, but may also be orientated to eliminate specific doubt. That proportion shall be at least 5 %.\nThe Member States which participate in the experiment shall compare the seed samples drawn officially with those of the same seed lot drawn under official supervision.\n6. The certification number required for the official labels prescribed under the Directives referred to in Article 1(1), or other appropriate alternatives, shall enable the Member States and the Commission to identify seed lots which have been sampled under official supervision.\n7. Where a Member State participates in the experiment, an appropriate proportion of the samples supplied by that Member State for Community comparative trials shall represent samples drawn under the experiment. The details shall be determined in the respective technical protocols for the Community comparative trials.", "1. Seed testing shall be carried out by seed testing laboratories which have been authorised for that purpose by the competent seed certification authority of the Member State concerned under the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 5.\n2. The laboratory shall have a seed analyst-in-charge who has direct responsibility for the technical operations of the laboratory and has the necessary qualifications for technical management of a seed testing laboratory.\nIts seed analysts shall have the necessary technical qualifications obtained in training courses organised under conditions applicable to official seed analysts and confirmed by official examinations.\nThe laboratory shall be maintained in premises and with equipment officially considered by the competent seed certification authority to be satisfactory for the purpose of seed testing, within the scope of the authorisation.\nIt shall carry out seed testing in accordance with current international methods.\n3. The laboratory shall be:\n(a) an independent laboratory,\nor\n(b) a laboratory belonging to a seed company.\nIn the case referred to in point (b), the laboratory may carry out seed testing only on seed lots produced on behalf of the seed company to which it belongs, unless it has been otherwise agreed between the seed company to which it belongs, the applicant for certification and the competent seed certification authority.\n4. In respect of their responsibilities vis-\u0102\u00a0-vis the competent seed certification authority, the seed analysts referred to in the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph 2 shall be assimilated to corresponding official analysts.\n5. The laboratory's performance of seed testing shall be subject to proper supervision by the competent seed certification authority.\n6. For the purposes of the supervision referred to in paragraph 5 a proportion of the seed lots entered for the official certification under the experiment shall be checktested by official seed testing. That proportion shall in principle be as evenly spread as possible over natural and legal persons entering seed for certification but may also be oriented to eliminate specific doubts. That proportion shall be at least 7 % in the case of seeds of cereals and 10 % in the case of seeds of other species.\nThe Member States which participate in the experiment shall compare the seed samples tested officially with those of the same seed lot tested under official supervision.\n7. The reference number of the lot required for the official labels prescribed under the Directives referred to in Article 1(1), or other appropriate alternatives, shall enable the Member States and the Commission to identify seed lots which have been tested under official supervision.\n8. Where a Member State participates in the experiment, an appropriate proportion of the samples supplied by that Member State for Community comparative trials shall represent samples tested under the experiment. The details shall be determined in the respective technical protocols for the Community comparative trials.", "The experiment and the release referred to in Article 1 shall expire on 30 June 2002.", "1. Member States shall inform the Commission and the other Member States within three months of the date of notification of this Decision:\n(a) whether they have decided to participate in the experiment,\n(b) in the case of participation solely in respect of seed sampling or solely in respect of seed testing, the scope thereof,\n(c) in the case of participation subject to restrictions to certain species, categories, regions or to other restrictions, the scope thereof.\nIf Member States decide to cease participating in the experiment, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States within three months.\n2.
