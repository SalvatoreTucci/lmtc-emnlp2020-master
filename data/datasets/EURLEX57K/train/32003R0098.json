Moreover, to take account, in particular, of trade flows with the rest of the Community and of the economic aspect of the proposed aid, an amount of aid should be laid down with reference to the refunds granted for the export of similar products to third countries, to be applied when this amount is greater that the above flat-rate amounts.\n(5) In the processed fruit and vegetable sector in the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, fixing this aid on the basis of the additional cost of transport, remoteness and the fact that these places are islands would significantly reduce the amounts which have been granted until now. In order not to disrupt the sectors concerned and so as to ensure the harmonious development of production, the reduction should be staggered over two years, even though this might mean continuing to study trade flows, and taking account of the economic aspect of the planned aid.\n(6) Pending a more detailed examination of the development of the livestock sectors in the outermost regions, and of the conditions for supplying breeding animals, the number of eligible animals and eggs should be renewed on a temporary basis and, where applicable, the aid for these supplies, taking into account the criteria referred to in Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001, Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 and Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001.\n(7) To take account of the special features of the various products in each sector, detailed arrangements for granting aid and establishing quantities for the supply of Community products to the outermost regions, as provided for in Article 3 of Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001 respectively, should be laid down as required.\n(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 of 28 December 2001 establishing the supply balances and Community aid for the outermost regions under Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2225/2002(8), has been amended several times. For the purposes of clarity, that Regulation should be repealed and the provisions thereof should be integrated into this Regulation.\n(9) To ensure that operations are carried out in an ordered fashion in 2003, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2003. However, operators who have applied for certificates on the basis of the amounts applicable under Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 should be allowed to receive them. In order to ensure the necessary monitoring and identify any undesirable developments which might require corrections from 2004, this Regulation should apply until the end of 2003.\n(10) The joint meeting of the Management Committees for cereals, pigmeat, poultrymeat and eggs, milk and milk products, beef and veal, sheepmeat and goatmeat, oils and fats, sugar, processed fruit and vegetables, hops, seeds and dried fodder has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["1.
