Under that Regulation, tenders may be submitted for the last time between 13 and 26 September 2007.\n(3) It is foreseeable that intervention stocks of sugar will continue to exist in most of the Member States concerned after expiry of that last possibility to submit tenders. In order to respond to the continued market needs, it is, therefore, appropriate to open a further standing invitation to tender to make these stocks available for export.\n(4) Export refunds may be fixed in accordance with Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006. Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particularly favourable competitive position. Therefore, refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished. Given the link between the granting of refunds and the resale for export of sugar held by the intervention agencies, a resale under this Regulation should neither be foreseen for export to those destinations.\n(5) In order to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, no export refund should be fixed for the countries of the western Balkans.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to fix a minimum quantity per tenderer or per lot.\n(7) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a maximum export refund for each partial invitation to tender.\n(8) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(9) Pursuant to Article 42(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, the price to be paid by the successful tenderer should be determined by the invitation to tender.\n(10) To take account of the different qualities of intervention sugar, this price should refer to sugar of the standard quality and provision should be made to adjust this price.\n(11) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to determine the period of validity of the export licences.\n(12) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States to the Commission on the quantities actually sold and exported.\n(13) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC)\u00a0No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC)\u00a0No 1262/2001\u00a0(4) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar pursuant to this Regulation.\n(14) The quantities available for a Member State that can be awarded when the Commission fixes the maximum export refund should take into account the quantities awarded pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1059/2007 of 14 September 2007 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden\u00a0(5).\n(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden shall offer for sale by standing invitation to tender for export to all destinations, excluding the destinations listed in the third subparagraph, a total quantity of 601\u00a0981 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention and available for export.\nThe maximum quantities involved per Member State are set out in Annex I.\nThe destinations referred to in the first subparagraph shall be:\n(a) third countries: Andorra, the Holy See (Vatican City State), Liechtenstein, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia\u00a0(6) and Montenegro;\n(b) territories of EU Member States not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: Gibraltar, Ceuta, Melilla, the Communes of Livigno and Campione d'Italia, Heligoland, Greenland, Faeroe Islands and the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The period during which tenders may be submitted in response to the first partial invitation to tender shall begin on 1 October 2007 and shall end on 10 October 2007 at 15.00, Brussels time.\nThe periods during which tenders may be submitted in response to the second and subsequent partial invitations shall begin on the first working day following the end of the preceding period.

The prices shall apply to white sugar and raw sugar of the standard quality described in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.\nFor intervention sugar which is not of the standard quality, Member States shall adjust the price by way of application mutatis mutandis of, respectively, Article 32(6) and Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Export licence applications and licences shall contain in Box 20 one of the entries listed in Annex III.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Export licences issued in connection with a partial invitation to tender shall be valid from the day of issue until the end of the fifth calendar month following that in which the partial invitation was issued.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the fifth working day at the latest after the Commission fixes the maximum export refund, the intervention agencies involved shall communicate to the Commission, in the form laid down in Annex IV, the exact quantity sold by partial invitation to tender.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not later than the end of each calendar month in respect of the preceding calendar month, Member States shall notify to the Commission the quantities of sugar of the export licences returned to the competent authorities and the corresponding quantities of sugar exported, taking account of the tolerances permitted by Article 8(4) and (5) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000\u00a0(7).", "By way of derogation from the second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, that Regulation shall apply to the resale, as referred to in Article 1 of this Regulation, of sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 September 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.
