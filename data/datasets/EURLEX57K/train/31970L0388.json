Arendt\n[1] OJ No L 42, 23.2.1970, p. 1.\n--------------------------------------------------\nANNEX I\n1. EEC TYPE APPROVAL OF AN AUDIBLE WARNING DEVICE\n1.1 The warning device shall emit a continuous sound.\n1.2 The warning device shall have acoustic characteristics (frequency spectrum of the sound, level of sound pressure) and mechanical characteristics such that it can satisfy the following tests, in the order indicated.\n1.2.1 Measurement of sound level\n1.2.1.1 The warning device shall be tested in a sufficiently silent and open area [1] (ambient noise and wind noise at least 10 db (A) below the noise being measured) or in an anechoic chamber; the microphone of the measuring instrument shall be located in the direction in which the subjective sound level is at a maximum and 2 m from the front surface of the device, the microphone and the device being positioned at a height of 1\u00b720 m above ground level.\n1.2.1.2 The measurements shall be made on the \"A\" weighting scale of the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standard, by means of sound-level meters conforming to the type described in Publications 179, 1st ed. (1965), of the International Electrotechnical Commission.\n1.2.1.3 The device shall be supplied with a voltage of 6\u00b75, 13 or 26 volts measured at the terminal of the source of electric power, corresponding respectively to a rated voltage of 6, 12 or 24 volts.\n1.2.1.4 The resistance of the connecting leads, including the resistance of the terminals and contacts, must be:\n0\u00b705 ohms for a 6 volt circuit\n0\u00b710 ohms for a 12 volt circuit\n0\u00b720 ohms for a 24 volt circuit\n1.2.1.5 The device shall be rigidly mounted, using the part or parts provided by the manufacturer, on a support whose mass is at least ten times that of the device and not less than 15 kg.\n1.2.1.6 Under the above conditions, the subjective sound pressure level must be not more than 118 dB (A) and not less than 105 dB (A).\n1.2.1.7 The time lapse between the moment of activation and the moment at which the sound reaches the minimum level laid down in item 1.2.1.6 above may not exceed 0\u00b72 seconds, measured in an ambient temperature of 20\u00b15 \u00b0C.\nThis provision shall apply in particular to pneumatically or electro-pneumatically operated devices.\n1.2.1.8 Devices which are pneumatically or electro-pneumatically operated must, with the pneumatic circuit arranged in accordance with the manufacturer's specification, have the same acoustic performance as that required for electrically operated audible warning devices.\n1.2.2 Endurance tests\n1.2.2.1 The warning device must be supplied with one of the rated voltages specified in item 1.2.1.3 above, through connecting leads having one of the resistances as specified in item 1.2.1.4 above, and be operated 50000 times, each time for a period of one second, followed by a four-second break. During the test, the device must be ventilated by an air current having a speed of approximately 10 m/s.\n1.2.2.2 If the test is carried out in an anechoic chamber, the latter must be of sufficient volmue to allow normal dispersal of the heat emitted by the device during the endurance test.\n1.2.2.3 The ambient temperatures in the test room be between + 15 and + 30 \u00b0C.\n1.2.2.4 If, after 25000 operations, the sound level of the device has changed in relation to the sound level before the test, the device may be adjusted. After 50000 operations and if necessary further adjustment the device must pass the test described in item 1.2.1 above.\n1.2.3 Acoustic tests\n1.2.3.1 The spectrum of the sound emitted by the device, measured at a distance of 2 m, must show a sound pressure higher than that of any frequency component above 3550 Hz in the 1800 to 3550 Hz frequency band, and in no case less than 105 dB (A).\n1.2.3.2 The requirements stated in item 1.2.3.1 above must be satisfied by a warning device which has been submitted to the test described in item 1.2.2 above and which is supplied with a voltage of between 115% and 95% of its rated voltage.\n1.2.3.3 The effective voltage shall be that laid down in item 1.2.1 above.\n1.2.3.4 The resistance of the connecting leads, including the resistance of the battery and the contacts, shall be that laid down in item 1.2.1 above.\n1.2.3.5 Both the device being tested and the microphone shall be placed at the same height; the microphone must be positioned facing the front surface of the warning device in the direction in which the subjective sound level is at a maximum.\n1.2.3.6 The device shall be rigidly mounted, using the part or parts provided by the manufacturer, on a support whose mass is at least ten times that of the device and in any event not less than 30 kg.\n1.2.3.7 The above test shall be made in an anechoic chamber.\n1.3 Type approval tests\n1.3.1 The type approval tests shall be carried out on two samples of each type submitted by the manufacturer for approval; both the samples shall be subjected to all the tests and must conform to the technical specifications laid down in this Annex.\n1.4 Type approval mark\n1.4.1 The type approval mark shall be made up of a rectangle, within which shall be placed the letter \"e\" followed by the distinguishing number of the country which has granted the approval (1 for Germany, 2 for France, 3 for Italy, 4 for the Netherlands, 6 for Belgium and 12 for Luxembourg). At any point within the immediate proximity of this rectangle there shall be placed a type approval number corresponding to the number of the approval certificate completed for the prototype.\n1.4.2 The approval mark (symbol and number) mentioned above shall be shown on the main body of the audible warning device in such a way that it is clearly visible from the outside after the warning device has been fitted on the vehicle.\n1.4.3 The various marks must be clearly legible and indelible.\n1.4.4 The dimensions of the approval mark drawn below are expressed in millimetres; they are minimum dimensions. The ratios between the dimensions must be maintained.\n TIFF \n2. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AUDIBLE WARNING DEVICE WHEN FITTED TO THE VEHICLE\n2.1 Acoustic tests\nWhen a vehicle is type approved, the characteristics of the warning device fitted to that type of vehicle shall be tested as follows:\n2.1.1 The sound pressure level of the device when fitted to the vehicle shall be measured at a point 7 m in front of the vehicle at a site which is open and as level as possible. The engine of the vehicle shall be stopped. The effective voltage shall be that laid down in item 1.2.1 above.\n2.1.2 Measurements shall be made on the \"A\" weighting scale of the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standard.\n2.1.3 The maximum sound pressure level shall be determined at a height of between 0\u00b75 and 1\u00b75 m above ground level.\n2.1.4 That maximum must be not less than 93 dB (A).\n[1] The aforementioned area may take the form, for instance, of an open space of 50 m radius having a central part of at least 20 m radius which is practically level, surfaced with concrete, asphalt or similar material, and not covered with powdery snow, tall grass, light soil or ashes. Measurements shall be carried out in fine weather. No person other than the observer taking the readings from the apparatus may remain near the audible warning device or the microphone, as the presence of spectators near cither the device or the microphone may considerably affect the readings from the apparatus. Fluctuations of the pointer which appear to be unrelated to the characteristics of the general sound level shall be ignored in taking readings.\n--------------------------------------------------\nANNEX II\nTYPE APPROVAL CERTIFICATE\n TIFF \n--------------------------------------------------"}
