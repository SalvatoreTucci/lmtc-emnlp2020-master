That list includes 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one.\n(2) 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive\u00a098/8/EC for use in product-type 21, antifouling products, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which corresponds to product-type 21 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(3) Norway was designated as Rapporteur and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 21 December 2010 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated in an assessment report reviewed within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 13 March 2014.\n(5) According to that assessment report, biocidal products used for product-type 21 and containing 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive\u00a098/8/EC, provided that certain specifications and conditions relating to its use are satisfied.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one for use in biocidal products for product-type 21 subject to compliance with such specifications and conditions.\n(7) Since the evaluation did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved in order to permit interested parties to take the preparatory measures necessary to meet the new requirements laid down.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 21, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0167, 27.6.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L\u00a0325, 11.12.2007, p.\u00a03).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L\u00a0123, 24.4.1998, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nCommon name IUPAC name Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\n4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one IUPAC Name: 950 g/kg 1 January 2016 31\u00a0December 2025 21 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n(1) For industrial or professional users, safe operational procedures and appropriate organizational measures shall be established.
