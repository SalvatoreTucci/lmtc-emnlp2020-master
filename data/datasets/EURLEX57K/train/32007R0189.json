In particular, in order to ensure fluid supply to the Community market, it is appropriate to maintain the intervals at which import licence applications are to be submitted as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 marketing years for the import and refining of sugar products under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements\u00a0(3), and it is therefore necessary to derogate from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n(4) To facilitate management and ensure monitoring and control of the quantities imported, the period of validity of import licences for sugar benefiting from the suspension of the application of import duties should be limited to the end of the 2006/2007 marketing year and the issue of import licences should be restricted to users of industrial sugar. These do not necessarily trade with third countries, and it is therefore necessary to derogate from Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n(5) The provisions on the management of the industrial raw material and the obligations on processors laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota\u00a0(4) should apply to the quantities imported under this Regulation.\n(6) The Management Committee for Sugar has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Suspension of import duties\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2006/2007 marketing year, the application of import duties on white sugar falling within CN code 1701\u00a099\u00a010 is suspended for a quantity of 200\u00a0000 tonnes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sugar imported under this Regulation shall be used specifically for the purposes of production of the products referred to in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 967/2006.", "Import licences\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules on import licences laid down by Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 and the rules laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 shall apply to imports of sugar carried out under this Regulation, unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\nHowever, import licences shall be valid until the end of the second month following their actual day of issue within the meaning of Article 23(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000\u00a0(5), and not later than 30 September 2007.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, applications for import licences for the quantities referred to in Article 1(1) may be submitted only by processors within the meaning of Article 2(d) of Regulation (EC) No 967/2006.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, import licence applications shall be submitted each week, from Monday to Friday, starting on the date referred to in Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 and until the issue of licences is discontinued as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 5(3) of that Regulation.
