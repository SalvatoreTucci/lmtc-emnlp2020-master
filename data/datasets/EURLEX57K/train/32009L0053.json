The terms of those marketing authorisations may subsequently be varied where, for instance, the production process or the address of the manufacturer has changed.\n(3) Article 39 of Directive 2001/82/EC and Article 35 of Directive 2001/83/EC empower the Commission to adopt an implementing regulation as regards variations subsequently made to marketing authorisations granted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 of Title III of Directive 2001/82/EC and Chapter 4 of Title III of Directive 2001/83/EC, respectively. The Commission therefore adopted Regulation (EC) No 1084/2003 of 3 June 2003 concerning the examination of variations to the terms of a marketing authorisation for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products granted by a competent authority of a Member State\u00a0(6).\n(4) However, the majority of medicinal products for human or veterinary use currently on the market have been authorised under purely national procedures and, as such, fall outside the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1084/2003. Variations to marketing authorisations granted under purely national procedures are thus subject to national rules.\n(5) Consequently, while the granting of all marketing authorisations for medicinal products is subject to harmonised rules within the Community, this is not the case for variations to the terms of marketing authorisations.\n(6) For reasons of public health and legal consistency, and with a view to reducing the administrative burden and strengthening predictability for economic operators, variations to all types of marketing authorisations should be subject to harmonised rules.\n(7) The rules on variations adopted by the Commission should pay particular attention to simplifying administrative procedures. To this effect, the Commission should provide, when adopting these rules, for the possibility of submitting a single application for one or more identical changes made to the terms of a number of marketing authorisations.\n(8) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\u00a0(7), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(9) Directive 2001/82/EC and Directive 2001/83/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Directive 2001/82/EC\nDirective 2001/82/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following Article shall be inserted:\n2. the second and third subparagraphs of Article 39(1) shall be deleted.", "Amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC\nDirective 2001/83/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following Article shall be inserted:\n2. the second and third subparagraphs of Article 35(1) shall be deleted.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 20 January 2011 at the latest.
