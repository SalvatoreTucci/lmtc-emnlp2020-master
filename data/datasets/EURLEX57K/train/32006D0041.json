Subsequently, the Paris Club creditors agreed on 21 July 2004 to a restructuring of Georgia\u2019s bilateral official debt on the Houston terms.\n(6) The new Government of Georgia also received strong support from the international community at the donors\u2019 conference held in Brussels on 16 June 2004.\n(7) The World Bank approved in June 2004 a USD 24 million Reform Support Credit, and will continue its assistance to Georgia under a new Country Partnership Strategy in the form of Poverty Reduction Support Operations.\n(8) The Georgian authorities have expressed their intention to pursue early debt repayments to the Community with a view to improving debt sustainability.\n(9) As EU-Georgia relations are developing within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is expected to lead to deeper economic integration, Community support for the government\u2019s economic reform programme is considered appropriate.\n(10) Making available an amount equivalent to the uncommitted grant component of the exceptional financial assistance, which would support the country\u2019s economic reforms and help reduce external indebtedness, is an appropriate contribution by the Community to the implementation of poverty reduction and growth strategies in Georgia.\n(11) In order to ensure efficient protection of the Community\u2019s financial interests in connection with the present macro-financial assistance, it is necessary to provide for appropriate measures by Georgia in relation to the prevention of and the fight against fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to this assistance, as well as for controls by the Commission and audits by the Court of Auditors.\n(12) The Commission services, with the support of duly mandated external experts, carried out in October 2004 an operational assessment of the financial circuits and administrative procedures at the Ministry of Finance of Georgia and the National Bank of Georgia to ascertain the existence of a framework for sound financial management.\n(13) The release of this grant assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority.\n(14) The Commission has consulted the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal.\n(15) The Treaty provides for no powers, other than those of Article 308 thereof, for the adoption of this Decision,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall make available to Georgia macro-financial assistance in the form of straight grants up to a maximum amount of EUR 33,5 million with a view to supporting economic reforms and helping the country improve debt sustainability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Community macro-financial assistance shall be managed by the Commission in consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee and in a manner fully consistent with the agreements reached between the IMF and Georgia.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community macro-financial assistance shall be made available for two years starting from the first day after the entry into force of this Decision.
