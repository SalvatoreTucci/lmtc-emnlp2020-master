Through that measure, those taxable persons would be exempted from all or some of the obligations in relation to VAT referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC.\n(2) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by Luxembourg by letter dated 9 November 2012. By letter dated 12 November 2012, the Commission notified Luxembourg that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n(3) According to Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Member States, which have not exercised the option under Article 14 of Second Council Directive 67/228/EEC\u00a0(2), may exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 5\u00a0000 or the equivalent in national currency and may also grant graduated tax relief to taxable persons whose annual turnover exceeds the ceiling fixed by them for its application.\n(4) Luxembourg has informed the Commission that it currently exempts from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 10\u00a0000 and that it makes use of the option of granting graduated tax relief with respect to taxable persons whose annual turnover is between EUR 10\u00a0000 and EUR 25\u00a0000. Luxembourg has requested the authorisation to exempt from VAT, as a derogating measure, taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25\u00a0000.\n(5) A higher threshold for the special scheme is a simplification measure, in so far as it may significantly reduce the VAT obligations of small businesses and would enable Luxembourg to cease applying the graduated tax relief scheme that is burdensome for businesses. Taxable persons should be still able to opt for the normal VAT arrangements.\n(6) On 29 October 2004, the Commission has adopted a proposal for a Council Directive amending Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC\u00a0(3) with a view to simplifying valued added tax obligations, which included provisions aimed at allowing Member States to set the annual turnover ceiling for the VAT exemption scheme at up to EUR 100\u00a0000 or the equivalent in national currency, with the possibility of updating that amount each year. This Decision is in line with that proposal.\n(7) The derogating measure has only a negligible effect on the overall amount of tax collected at the stage of final consumption and will not adversely affect the Union\u2019s own resources accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Luxembourg is authorised to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25\u00a0000.", "This Decision shall take effect on the day of its notification.\nThis Decision shall apply until the date of entry into force of Union rules amending the amounts of the annual turnover ceilings below which taxable persons may qualify for VAT exemption or until 31 December 2016, whichever date is earlier.", "This Decision is addressed to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 November 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nR. \u0160AD\u017dIUS\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Second Council Directive 67/228/EEC of 11 April 1967 on the harmonization of legislation of Member States concerning turnover taxes, structure and procedures for application of the common system of value added tax (OJ 71, 14.4.1967, p. 1303/67).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes \u2014 Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (OJ L 145, 13.6.1977, p. 1)."}
