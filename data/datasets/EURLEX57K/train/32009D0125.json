In the last decade this disease has shown a very clear tendency to spread, both in Africa and Asia.\n(3) Morocco has informed the Commission that sheep and goat plague has been detected on its territory and has spread in a very short time extensively. The strain of the virus detected recently in Morocco is of a type that was not found hitherto in Africa.\n(4) Sheep and goat plague can be controlled through vaccination, and a vaccine is available that will protect against all serotypes and which gives a long lasting protection against the disease.\n(5) The authorities in Morocco have prepared a vaccination strategy. They have sent the strategy to the Commission and have asked for Community financial support.\n(6) The spread to the Community of sheep and goat plague cannot always be prevented by the measures put in place at the Community borders, while an outbreak of such a disease in the Community would have very serious consequences and therefore needs to be averted. For this reason it is appropriate to support Morocco in its efforts to control the disease, to prevent it becoming endemic in this country, and to make vaccines available to Morocco for the vaccination campaign against Sheep and goat plague. The maximum amount of that contribution should be specified.\n(7) Because of the urgency of the situation, the measures provided for in this Decision should preferably be completed by 31 May 2009 at the latest.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall provide to the Moroccan authorities vaccines against sheep and goat plague, for use in the ongoing vaccination campaign in Morocco against that disease.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be carried out by the Commission in cooperation with the authorities in Morocco.
