With the support of the Community, the OIE subsequently adopted, in May 2005, principles and specific guidelines for the welfare of animals subject to international trade, and in particular in relation to sea, land and air transport, as Section 3.7 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. In order to give effect to Article 3.7.2.1 of the Guidelines for the Transport of Animals by Sea and Article 3.7.3.1 of the Guidelines for the Transport of Animals by Land, which define the responsibilities of the Competent Authorities, it is appropriate to strengthen the instruments for the monitoring and evaluation of the welfare performance by improving the reporting system of inspections performed by the Member States targeting animal welfare conditions for the animals exported from the Community.\n(2) To facilitate an in-depth evaluation on the application of Commission Regulation (EC) No 639/2003\u00a0(3), Member States should be required to provide detailed statistical information on cases of non-payment of export refunds. To this end, information should be concentrated at the level of the paying agencies, which will also contribute to gain additional transparency. It should therefore be provided that the veterinarian authority responsible for the exit point forwards a copy of the inspection report of the exit point to the paying agency.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 639/2003 provides for checks to be carried out after leaving the customs territory of the Community. Moreover, it provides that checks may only be carried out by a veterinarian. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of these checks it should be provided that they may only be carried out by a veterinarian who holds a formal qualification in veterinary medicine within the meaning of Council Directive 78/1026/EEC of 18 December 1978 concerning the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in veterinary medicine, including measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment and freedom to provide services\u00a0(4).\n(4) Alternatively, without prejudice to the respective competences of the Community and the Member States, Member States should be required to verify that the international control and supervisory agencies check that veterinarians holding a qualification not covered by Directive 78/1026/EEC possess the knowledge of the requirements imposed by Council Directive 91/628/EEC of 19 November 1991 on the protection of animals during transport and amending Directives 90/425/EEC and 91/496/EEC\u00a0(5).\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 639/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) This Regulation should apply after an appropriate timeframe for the implementation of the amendments.\n(7) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 639/2003 is amended as follows:\n1.
