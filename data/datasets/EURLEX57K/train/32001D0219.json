Moreover, infestations of non-manufactured coniferous wood packing material originating in Canada and China were also reported by Sweden and France respectively.\n(3) Finland took official emergency measures stipulating that as of 31 May 2000, packing material consisting of wood of conifers, except Thuja L., but including wood to support or wedge cargo, originating in non-member countries where PWN is known to occur (namely Canada, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Taiwan and the United States of America), must, when entering into Finland, be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate certifying that the wood has undergone one of the treatments specified in the Finnish emergency measures.\n(4) Directive 2000/29/EC currently requires that, in order to protect the Community from the introduction of PWN, non-manufactured coniferous wood originating in non-member countries where the nematode is found must be free of bark and grub holes, and have a moisture content of less than 20 %. The abovementioned information from Finland, France and Sweden shows that these measures are not sufficient to protect the Community adequately against the introduction of PWN when such wood is imported from Canada, China, Japan and the United States of America. Therefore temporary emergency measures are necessary.\n(5) These emergency measures should apply to imports of non-manufactured wood packing obtained in whole or in part of coniferous wood, originating in Canada, China, Japan and the United States of America, into the Community. However, it is not necessary to apply such measures to wood of Thuja L., because Thuja L. is not susceptible to PWN.\n(6) The emergency measures should be applied in two steps. In the first step, the Member States should immediately take any appropriate measures for official monitoring of the said wood in order to further reduce the risk of introduction into or spread within the Community of PWN. This would enable the countries where the nematode is known to occur, to organise treatment of wood packing, comprised in whole or in part of non-manufactured coniferous wood, except that of Thuja L., in compliance with the requirements of this Decision as the second step.\n(7) Measures to be taken in cases of non-compliance should be specified.\n(8) If it becomes apparent that the emergency measures referred to in the present Decision are not sufficient to prevent the entry of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al., or have not been complied with, more stringent or alternative measures should be envisaged.\n(9) The effect of the emergency measures should be assessed continually until 15 June 2002, in particular on the basis of information to be provided by Member States. Possible subsequent measures will be considered in the light of the results of that assessment.\n(10) The above emergency measures will also be reviewed in the light of the outcome of discussions currently ongoing in respect of the development of a FAO International Standard on \"Guidelines for regulating non-manufactured wood packing in use for the transport of commodities.\"\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["1. For the purposes of this Decision \"susceptible wood\" means wood packing comprised in whole or in part of non-manufactured wood of conifers (Coniferales), except that of Thuja L., originating in Canada, China, Japan and the United States of America in the form of packing cases, boxes, crates, drums and similar packings, pallets, box pallets and other load boards, pallet collars, whether or not actually in use in the transport of objects of all kinds.\n2. Susceptible wood may only be introduced into the territory of the Community if it complies with the emergency measures laid down in the Annex to this Decision.\n3. The provisions specified in points 1, 2 and in point 3 second indent of the Annex to this Decision shall apply only to susceptible wood destined for the Community and originating in the above countries on or after 1 October 2001. The provisions specified in point 3 first indent of the Annex to this Decision shall apply from the date of notification of this Decision to the Member States, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4.\n4.
