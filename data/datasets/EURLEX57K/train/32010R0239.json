Annex B to that Directive sets out a list of general conditions for the approval of such centres.\n(2) Article 10(4)(b) of Directive 91/496/EEC, as amended by Council Directive 2008/73/EC of 15 July 2008 simplifying procedures of listing and publishing information in the veterinary and zootechnical fields\u00a0(3), introduced a simplified procedure of listing and publishing a list of approved quarantine centres where live animals are to be placed in quarantine or isolation if so required by Union legislation. Under that new procedure, which applies from 1 January 2010, the competence to establish the list of approved quarantine centres which comply with the general conditions set out in Annex B to that Directive no longer lies with the Commission, but with the Member States.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 318/2007\u00a0(4) lays down the animal health conditions for imports into the Union of certain birds other than poultry. Article 6 of that Regulation provides that approved quarantine facilities and centres are to meet also the minimum conditions set out in Annex IV thereto. In addition, Annex V to that Regulation sets out the list of the approved quarantine facilities and centres.\n(4) In the interests of simplification of Union legislation, it is necessary to amend Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 and to delete Annex V thereto in order to reflect the new procedures for approval and listing of quarantine facilities and centres foreseen in Directive 91/496/EEC, as amended by Directive 2008/73/EC. Some Member States have already started drawing up lists of approved quarantine centres in order to transpose the provisions of Article 10(4)(b) of Directive 91/496/EEC. Therefore, in the interest of clarity of Union legislation, it is appropriate that the amendments to Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 be applicable as of the same date of application of Directive 91/496/EEC.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 is amended as follows:\n1.
