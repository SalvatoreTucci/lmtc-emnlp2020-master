The Community Tobacco Fund has always been funded by the transfer of part of the tobacco aids. Such transfer for calendar years 2006 and 2007 was initially proposed when the introduction of the tobacco sector into the single payment scheme was to be accompanied by a transitional tobacco aid to be paid in the same years. Council Regulation (EC) No 864/2004\u00a0(4) finally extended the tobacco aid to 2008 and 2009 without accordingly extending the funding of the Community Tobacco Fund by a reduction of the tobacco aid.\n(3) Actions funded by the Community Tobacco Fund have proved to be very successful as well as a positive example of cooperation between agriculture and health policies. In order to ensure the continuation of those actions, and taking into account that the Fund has always been funded by transfer from the tobacco aid, it is appropriate to transfer an amount equal to 5\u00a0% of the tobacco aid granted for the calendar years 2008 and 2009 to the Community Tobacco Fund.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Article 110m of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 110m\nTransfer to the Community Tobacco Fund\nAn amount equal to 4\u00a0% for the calendar year 2006 and 5\u00a0% for the calendar years 2007, 2008 and 2009 of the aid granted in accordance with this Chapter shall finance actions of information under the Community Tobacco Fund provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92.\u2019", "Article 104(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) for the calendar years 2006 to 2009, in accordance with Article 110m of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 May 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
