whereas afforestation of agricultural land withdrawn from agricultural production in recent  years has proved unsatisfactory;\nWhereas, therefore, the measures provided for in Title VIII of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2328/91 of 15 July 1991 on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures (4) should be replaced by measures which provide more effective encouragement for  afforestation of agricultural land;\nWhereas the eligible amounts of the costs of afforestation must correspond to the effective costs of afforestation observed in the Community;\nWhereas a degressive premium for the first five years to alleviate the cost of maintenance of new woodlands may contribute significantly towards the encouragement of afforestation;\nWhereas, in order to increase afforestation of agricultural land as a way of furthering the aims of the common agricultural policy (CAP), it is necessary to introduce premiums to compensate for the income loss incurred by farmers during the  non-productive period of afforested agricultural land;\nWhereas, in many cases, private persons other than farmers are in a position to undertake afforestation of agricultural land and whereas provisions should be made for incentives to be offered to such persons; whereas, therefore, a premium per hectare  should be introduced for the benefit of private persons other than farmers who undertake afforestation of agricultural land;\nWhereas, in many parts of the Community, afforestation of agricultural land may be undertaken by public authorities, in particular local authorities; whereas, therefore, afforestation schemes undertaken by such authorities should be supported and  reinforced;\nWhereas afforestation with fast-growing species cultivated on the basis of a short felling cycle is generally fairly profitable; whereas, therefore, for afforestation with these species, it is sufficient to provide Community assistance for afforestation  costs incurred by farmers practising farming as a main occupation;\nWhereas the improvement of existing farm woodlands can help to improve the incomes of persons employed in farming; whereas, in particular, because of the structure of cork production and its specific problems, measures to preserve, densify and improve  existing cork oak stands should be reinforced;\nWhereas, given that the Community is to contribute to the financing of the measure, it must be able to ascertain that the implementing arrangements adopted by the Member States contribute towards the attainment of its objectives; whereas, for this  purpose, a structure for cooperation should be set up between the Member States and the Commission in the Standing Forestry Committee set up by Decision 89/367/EEC (5);\nWhereas the resources available for implementing the measures provided for in this Regulation must be additional to those available for the implementation of measures under the rules governing the Structural Funds, and in particular for measures  applicable in regions covered by Objectives 1 and 5(b) as defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 (6),", "main_body": ["Purpose of the aid scheme\nA Community aid scheme part-financed by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) is hereby instituted in order to:\n- accompany the changes to be introduced under the market organization rules,\n- contribute towards an eventual improvement in forest resources,\n- contribute towards forms of countryside management more compatible with environmental balance,\n- combat the greenhouse effect and absorb carbon dioxide.\nThis Community aid scheme shall promote:\n(a) afforestation as an alternative use of agricultural land;\n(b) the development of forestry activities on farms.", "Aid scheme\n1. The aid scheme may comprise:\n(a) aid for afforestation costs;\n(b) an annual premium per hectare afforested to cover maintenance cost in the first five years;\n(c) an annual premium per hectare to cover losses of income resulting from afforestation of agricultural land;\n(d) investment aid for the improvement of woodlands by the provision of shelterbelts, firebreaks, waterpoints and forest roads, and for the improvement of cork oak stands.\n2. (a) Aid as referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (b) may be granted to any natural or legal person undertaking afforestation of agricultural land.\n(b) Aid as referred to in paragraph 1 (c) shall be eligible only if it is granted to:\n- farmers not participating in the early-retirement scheme introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2079/92 of 30 June 1992 instituting a Community aid scheme for early retirement from farming (7),\n- any other private-law, natural or legal person.\n(c) In the case of fast-growing species cultivated in the short term, aid as referred to in paragraph 1 (a) shall be eligible only if it is granted to farmers practising farming as a main occupation in accordance with Article 5 (1) (a) of Regulation  (EEC) No 2328/91 and provided that the planting is adapted to local conditions compatible with the environment.\n(d) The planting of Christmas trees shall not be eligible.\n(e) Aid as referred to in paragraph 1 (d) shall be eligible only if it is granted to farmers or associations thereof.\n3.

Member States may also devise zonal afforestation plans reflecting the diversity of environmental situations, natural conditions and agricultural structures.\nZonal afforestation plans shall be concerned in particular with:\n- the setting of an afforestation objective,\n- conditions in respect of the location and grouping of areas which may be afforested,\n- forestry practices to be complied with,\n- selection of species of trees adapted to local conditions.", "Programme appraisal procedure\n1.
