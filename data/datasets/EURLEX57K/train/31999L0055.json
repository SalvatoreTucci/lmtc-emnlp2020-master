In the case of a tractor with a reversible driving position (i.e. with a reversible seat and steering wheel), the first impact shall be longitudinal and shall be applied at the heaviest extremity (with more than 50 % of the mass of the tractor). It shall be followed by a crushing test at the same extremity. The second impact shall be on the lightest extremity, and the third impact shall be from the side. Lastly, a second crushing test shall be carried out on the lightest extremity.\";\n3. Part B of Annex III is amended as follows:\n(a) the following text is added at the end of the second paragraph of item 1.3.1: \"In the case of a tractor with a reversible driving position (i.e. with a reversible seat and steering wheel), the point of impact shall be determined in relation to the intersection of the median plane of the tractor and of a plane perpendicular to it, by a straight line passing through a point that is equidistant from the two seat reference points.\";\n(b) the following items 2.2.11, 2.2.12 and 2.2.13 are added: \"2.2.11.

In the case of a tractor which can be fitted with optional seats, the tests shall be based on the combined clearance of the seat reference points for all available seat-fitting options. The roll-over protection structure must not enter the combined clearance around the various seat reference points.\n2.2.13. Where a new option for the seat is proposed after the test has taken place, a calculation is made to determine whether the clearance around the new seat reference point is located entirely within the combined clearance established previously. If this is not the case, a new test is required.\""}
