That new method is to apply from 1 January 2014 but may be applied on a voluntary basis since 1 January 2013.\n(2) Point 7 of Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 provides that the specific emissions of CO2 of completed vehicles are to be allocated to the manufacturer of the base vehicle. This requires that completed vehicles can be recognised in the monitoring process and that the manufacturer of the base vehicle can be identified. It also requires certain data relating to the base vehicle to be determined in accordance with the new methodology set out in Annex XII to Regulation (EC) No 692/2008.\n(3) The manufacturers of the base vehicles have, in accordance with Article 8(5) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, the right to verify the data relating to a multi-stage vehicle, on the basis of which their specific CO2 emission targets are calculated. It is therefore appropriate to lay down detailed provisions on the exchange of relevant data between the manufacturers and the Commission.\n(4) Due to the specificities and design of their vehicle registration systems, Member States may however not be able\u00a0to provide all the data relevant for the monitoring of multi-stage vehicles that are indicated in the detailed data\u00a0specified in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. As a consequence, the Commission should have the possibility to take into account data provided by manufacturers as part of the verification process pursuant to Article\u00a08(5) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 for determining the preliminary specific emissions targets.\n(5) Manufacturers should therefore provide the Commission and the European Environment Agency (EEA) with the vehicle identification numbers (VINs) that they assigned to light commercial vehicles sold in the preceding calendar year or for which a warranty was issued in that year. Manufacturers should also have the possibility to provide the Commission with the detailed data related to those vehicles. In order to take those data into account for the calculation of the provisional targets, manufacturers should provide their data to the Commission and the EEA at the same time as the annual data submission of the Member States.\n(6) By matching the detailed data provided by Member States with those provided by the manufacturers, based on the VINs, the Commission should prepare a provisional dataset for the calculation of the preliminary targets. The provisional dataset to be notified to a manufacturer should include the VINs for those records where the two datasets can be matched. Where necessary, the provisional dataset should also include those records where the Member States' VINs are not matched by VINs delivered by the manufacturer. In that case the records should be transmitted to the manufacturer without the VINs. The provisional dataset, with exception of the VINs, should be made public in accordance with Article 8(4) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011.\n(7) In order to ensure full parallelism of the requirements set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0293/2012\u00a0(3) with those applicable to passenger cars set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No\u00a01014/2010\u00a0(4), it is appropriate to adapt the requirements for the notification of errors by manufacturers in accordance with the provisions of that Regulation.\n(8) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 293/2012 should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 293/2012 is amended
