The concerned Member States have taken these measures as these jelly mini-cups combine several risk factors due to their consistence, shape, size and manner of ingestion, giving rise to a risk that they remain blocked in the throat and provoke choking. The Commission has been informed of these measures.\n(4) The Commission has examined the information given by the Member States together with the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(5) On the basis of the information provided by the Member States who adopted measures at national level, it can be concluded that jelly mini-cups containing additives derived from seaweed and/or certain gums constitute a life-threatening risk. Even if the shape, size and manner of ingestion are the main cause, the risk also originates from the chemical and physical properties of these additives which contribute to the cause for jelly mini-cups to constitute a serious risk to human health.\n(6) In the present case, warning through labelling would not be sufficient to protect human health, especially with regard to children.\n(7) Community-wide measures are necessary to provide adequate protection of human health, due to the disparity of the measures taken by some Member States and the fact that other Member States have not taken any measures at all.\n(8) It is necessary to suspend the placing on the market of jelly mini-cups containing one or more of the food additives E 400, E 401, E 402, E 403, E 404, E 405, E 406, E 407, E 407a, E 410, E 412, E 413, E 414, E 415, E 417 and/or E 418 and the use of these additives in jelly mini-cups and imports of jelly mini-cups containing these additives in order to protect human health.\n(9) The Commission will consult the European Food Safety Authority on this matter as it is of public health relevance and, on the basis of the scientific opinion of the Authority, it will review the present decision and examine whether there is a need to propose to the European Parliament and to the Council an amendment to Directive 95/2/EC.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision, jelly mini-cups means jelly confectionery of a firm consistence, contained in semi-rigid mini-cups or mini-capsules, intended to be ingested in a single bite by exerting pressure on the mini-cup or mini-capsule to project the confectionery into the mouth and containing food additives derived from seaweed and/or certain gums.", "1.
