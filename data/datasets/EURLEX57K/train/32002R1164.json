For the 2000/2001 and previous marketing years, the adjustment aid and additional aid were determined, inter alia, on the basis of the applicable storage levy. For the 2001/2002 marketing year, the compensation system for storage costs was abolished and the aid in question set on the assumption that the balance between the manufacturing margin and the refining margin has not been affected by the abolition of the aforementioned system and pending a study of economic developments in the two sectors to establish in particular whether the way in which the two margins have developed warrants continuation of the adjustment aid and additional aid.\n(3) The analyses carried out lead to the conclusion that the aid to the refining industry should continue to maintain balance with the manufacture of white beet sugar in the period for which prices in the sugar sector are set, i.e. for the 2002/2003 to 2005/2006 marketing years. The level of the aid set for the 2001/2002 marketing year is commensurate with developments in the situation in particular after the abolition of the compensation system for storage costs.\n(4) The Management Committee for Sugar has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1646/2001 is replaced by the following: \"Article 3\n1.
