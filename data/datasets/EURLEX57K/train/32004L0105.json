As a consequence of those amendments different models of the certificates were approved to accompany plants, plant products and other objects when moving in international traffic.\n(4) Although the amendments of the IPPC in 1997 have not yet entered into force, Resolution 12/97 of the 29th session of the Conference of the FAO allowed the use of the amended certificates as an alternative and on voluntary basis among Contracting Parties to the IPPC that accept them. It appeared that many Contracting Parties to the IPPC already use the certificates based on the models specified in the Annex to the IPPC, as amended in 1997.\n(5) The models of certificates to accompany plants, plant products or other objects for entry into the Community should be determined.\n(6) National plant protection organisations usually stock up certificates in large quantities. It is appropriate to lay down rules for the use of certificates based on the models specified in the Annex to IPPC, as amended in 1979, during a transitional period.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of Article 13(1)(ii) of Directive 2000/29/EC, the Member States shall accept official \u2018phytosanitary certificates\u2019 or \u2018phytosanitary certificates for re-export\u2019 (certificates) accompanying plants, plant products or other objects listed in Part B of Annex V to Directive 2000/29/EC coming from contracting third countries to the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) which are issued in accordance with the models as specified in Annex I.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall only accept the certificates referred to in paragraph 1 provided that they have been completed taking into account the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 12 on Guidelines for phytosanitary certificates.", "The Member States shall accept certificates issued in accordance with the models as specified in Annex II, until 31 December 2009.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2004 at the latest.
