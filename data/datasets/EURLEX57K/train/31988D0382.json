Chemical industries using mercury catalysts\n1.1 For the production of vinyl chloride\nFor existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 milligrams of mercury per litre of discharge applies. For existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,2 grams of mercury per tonne of vinyl chloride production capacity applies 1 July 1986\n1.2 for the manufacture of other products\nFor existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 milligrams of mercury per litre of discharge applies For existing discharges the provisional limit value of 10 grams of mercury per kilogram treated applies 1 July 1986\n2. The manufacture of mercury catalysts used in the production of vinyl chloride\nFor existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 milligrams of mercury per litre of discharge applies For existing discharges the provisional limit value of 1,4 grams of mercury per kilogram of mercury treated applies 1 July 1986\n3. The manufacture of organic and non-organic mercury compounds (except the products covered by point 2)\nFor existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 milligrams of mercury per litre of discharge applies For existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 grams of mercury per kilogram of mercury treated applies 1 July 1986\n4. Manufacture of primary batteries containing mercury\nFor existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 milligrams of mercury per litre of discharge applies For existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,05 grams of mercury per kilogram of mercury treated applies 1 July 1986\n5. Non-ferrous metal industries\n5.1 Establishments for the recovery of mercury\nFor existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 milligrams per litre of discharge applies  1 July 1986\n5.2 Extraction and refining of non-ferrous metals\nFor existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 milligrams of mercury per litre of discharge applies  1 July 1986\n6. Establishments for the treatment of toxic waste containing mercury\nFor existing discharges the provisional limit value of 0,1 milligrams of mercury per litre of discharge applies  1 July 1986\nIf necessary, limit values for other industries, such as paper, steel and coal-fired power stations, will be proposed by the International Commission at a later stage. In the meantime, governments will fix emission standards for mercury autonomously in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Convention. These standards must take account of the best technical means available and must not be less stringent than the nearest comparable limit value in Annex IV.\nPursuant to Articles 14 and 19 of the Convention, these provisions will enter into force after their unanimous acceptance by the Contracting Parties to the Convention.\nThe Contracting Parties will notify their adoption to the Government of the Swiss Confederation which will acknowledge receipt of notification.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The limit values given in the table represent a monthly average concentration or a monthly average load.\nThe amounts of mercury discharged are expressed in terms of the quantity of mercury treated by a given industrial establishment during the same period or in terms of a plant's installed vinyl chloride production capacity.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Limit values, expressed in terms of concentration, are given in the above table for industries 1 to 4 and should not, in principle, be exceeded. In no case may the limit values expressed in terms of maximum concentration exceed those expressed in terms of maximum quantity divided by water requirements per kilogram of mercury treated or per tonne of installed vinyl chloride production capacity.\nNevertheless, as the concentration of mercury in effluents depends on the volume of water involved, and as this differs from one process and establishment to the next, the limit values, expressed in terms of the quantity of mercury discharged as compared with the quantity of mercury treated or the installed vinyl chloride capacity given in the above table, must be complied with at all times.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The limit values given in the above table refer to the amount of mercury contained in an unfiltered sample. They apply to total mercury in all waste water resulting from production processes and discharged from the site of the production plant.\nDischarges containing mercury shall be treated off the premises of the production plant in an establishment designed for the disposal of mercury. Governments may permit the limit values to apply at the point where the discharge leaves the plant.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Average daily limit values shall be equivalent to double the corresponding average monthly limit values given in the table.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of experience gained in applying these provisions the International Commission will submit to the Contracting Parties proposals relating to the non-ferrous metals industry and intended to lay down more stringent limit values for entry into force 10 years after the adoption of these provisions."}
