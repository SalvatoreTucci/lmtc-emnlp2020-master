whereas, as a result, they should no longer be  covered by Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2759/75;\nWhereas since pig fats from bones or waste are not listed in Annex II to the Treaty they are  excluded from application of the provisions therein concerning agriculture, whilst lard and other  pig fats obtained from other parts of the animal are subject thereto; whereas in the harmonized  system fats from bones or waste are classified in the same heading of the nomenclature as lard and  other pig fats; whereas, because of the technical development in the processing of animal fats, it  is impossible to distinguish between fats from bones or waste and lard and other fats obtained from  swine; whereas measures adopted for lard and other pig fats in respect of trade with third  countries and the marketing rules adopted for lard and other pig fats should therefore be extended  to fats from bones or waste of swine;\nWhereas homogenized preparations of meat, meat offal or blood, preparations of animal blood, and  stuffed pasta containing more than 20 % by weight of sausages and the like, meat and meat offal,  including fats, may be classified, according to their essential character, in various subheadings  of heading N\u00b0 16.02 of the Common Customs Tariff at present in force; whereas, in the combined  nomenclature, single subheadings have been established to cover all homogenized preparations,  preparations of blood of any animal and stuffed pasta containing more than 20 % by weight of  sausages and the like, meat and meat offal, including fats of any kind or origin;

whereas, under Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2658/87, the changes made may be  of a technical nature only; whereas, accordingly, a provision should be introduced whereby all  other adjustments to Council and Commission regulations on the common organization of the market in  pigmeat\nshould be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 of Regulation (EEC)  N\u00b0 2759/75, provided\nthat such adjustments are required solely as a result of the introduction of  the harmonized system,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2759/75 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
