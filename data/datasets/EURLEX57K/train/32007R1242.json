Additional measures should be added in order to ensure the proper functioning and the efficiency of the programme. It should therefore be made possible to make payments at any time of the year for import and supply of live animals as well as for the measures referred to in Article 50 of that Regulation.\n(4) The procedures for amendments to programmes provided for in Article 49 of Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 need to be more precise. It is appropriate to specify the rules for the submission of the requests for amendments to the overall programmes and for their approval by the Commission, as well as the timing for their application. Due to budgetary rules, the approved amendments should be implemented as from 1 January of the year following the request for amendment. Moreover, there should be a distinction between major amendments requiring approval by a Commission Decision and minor amendments that should only be notified to the Commission for information.\n(5) The current wording of Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 needs to be clarified in a more precise way with reference to the relating Article of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006.\n(6) In order to ensure a smooth transition from the previous arrangements applying until 2006 as regards the possibility to make use of electronic certificates for the purposes of aid under the Specific Supply Arrangements and as regards the possibility to make payments throughout the year for the import and supply of live animals as well as for the measures referred to in Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 793/2006, the amendments to Articles 5(2), 7(2) and 29 should be applicable as from the date on which the Commission has notified its approval of the relevant Member State's overall programme in accordance with Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
