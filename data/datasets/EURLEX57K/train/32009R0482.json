It is necessary to determine the procedure under which the Member States may use that possibility as well as the mechanism through which it will be ensured that the overall contribution rate from the EAFRD shall be respected over the whole programming period.\n(4) In order to facilitate the implementation of local development strategies and in particular the functioning of local action groups, as defined in Article 62 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, the possibility to make advance payments related to their running costs should be provided.\n(5) In view of the general environmental benefit resulting from the transfer of a holding, or part of it, to an organisation having the objective of nature management, Member States should be allowed not to require the beneficiary for reimbursement in case the organisation does not take over the commitment given as a condition for the grant of assistance.\n(6) The implementation of the operations concerning investments associated with the maintenance, restoration and upgrading of the natural heritage and with the development of high natural value sites, provided in Article 57(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, should be facilitated. Therefore, Member States should be allowed to fix the level of support for such operations on the basis of standard costs and standard assumptions of income foregone, as already provided for the operations of similar nature in accordance with Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006.\n(7) In order to allow Member States to benefit from Article 70(4b) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 the rules for the calculation of the Community contribution in the context of the EAFRD accounts, provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006\u00a0(5), should be adapted.\n(8) Regulations (EC) No 1974/2006 and (EC) No 883/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) In order to be consistent with the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 473/2009, to which the provisions of this Regulation are complementary, this Regulation should apply as of 1 January 2009. Such retroactive application should not infringe the principle of legal certainty of the beneficiaries concerned.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Rural Development Committee and the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
