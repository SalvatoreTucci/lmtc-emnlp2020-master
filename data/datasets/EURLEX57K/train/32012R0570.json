In order to avoid secondary fermentation in the bottle, sorbic acid \u2014 sorbates (E 200-203) are used and subsequent pasteurisation is required. However, pasteurisation alters and degrades the natural fruit aromas and flavours of the product. Addition of benzoates has a synergistic effect with sorbates, allowing a better preservation and reducing the need to pasteurise.\n(6) Alcohol-free counterparts of wine are presented and marketed as alternative to wine to adults who choose not to drink alcoholic beverages. Consumption of these counterparts does not substitute consumption of soft drinks. The additional exposure to benzoic acid \u2014 benzoates (E 210-213) based on this new use will therefore remain limited and will not lead to exceedence of the acceptable daily intake established by the Scientific Committee for Food\u00a0(3). It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of benzoic acid \u2014 benzoates (E 210-213) for the preservation of alcohol-free counterparts of wine.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of benzoic acid \u2014 benzoates (E 210-213) for the preservation of alcohol-free counterparts of wine constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(8) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives\u00a0(4), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of benzoic acid \u2014 benzoates (E 210-213) in alcohol-free counterparts of wine before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to this use of that food additive.\n(9) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/reports/scf_reports_35.pdf\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 295, 12.11.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the following entry is inserted in the food category 14.2.2 \u2018Wine and other products defined by Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, and alcohol-free counterparts\u2019 after the entry for E 200-203:\n\u2018E 210-213 Benzoic acid \u2014 benzoates 200 (1) (2) only alcohol-free Period of application:"}
