A period of one month is the most appropriate response to this need, taking account of businesses\u2032 accounting and financial periods and the objectives of reducing the administrative burden on businesses.\n(2) In view of the amendments to the period for declaring intra-Community transactions made by Council Directive 2008/117/EC of 16 December 2008 amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions\u00a0(3), it is necessary to amend the references to that period in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003\u00a0(4).\n(3) Since the objectives of the proposed action to tackle VAT evasion cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, whose action in the matter depends on information collected by the other Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the need to involve all Member States, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(4) Since the amendments contained in this Regulation are necessary to adapt Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 to the measures provided for in Directive 2008/117/EC, with which the Member States have to comply by 1 January 2010, this Regulation must enter into force on the same date.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 23, the second paragraph shall be replaced by the following:\n2.
