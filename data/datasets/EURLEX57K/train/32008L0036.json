More particularly, those measures are designed to extend the list of legal forms, amend the list of classes of insurance or adapt the terminology used in that list, clarify the items constituting the solvency margin, alter the minimum guarantee fund, amend the list of assets acceptable as cover for technical provisions and the rules on the spreading of investments, change the relaxations in the matching rules and clarify definitions. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directives 73/239/EEC, 88/357/EEC and 92/49/EEC, inter alia, by supplementing them with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Directive 92/49/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since the amendments made to Directive 92/49/EEC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States. It is therefore not necessary to lay down provisions to that effect,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nIn Article 51 of Directive 92/49/EEC, the introductory wording shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018The following technical adjustments designed to amend non-essential elements of Directives 73/239/EEC and 88/357/EEC and of this Directive, inter alia, by supplementing them, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 2 of Directive 91/675/EEC:\u2019.", "Entry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "Addressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 11 March 2008.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.
