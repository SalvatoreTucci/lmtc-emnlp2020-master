Given the continued existence of intervention stocks, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to sell for industrial use sugar held by the intervention agencies.\n(2) Such a decision was taken by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1476/2007 of 13 December 2007 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale for industrial use of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden and amending Regulations (EC) Nos 1059/2007 and 1060/2007\u00a0(3). Under that Regulation, tenders may be submitted for the last time between 10 and 24 September 2008.\n(3) It is foreseeable that intervention stocks of sugar will continue to exist in most of the Member States concerned after expiry of that last possibility to submit tenders. In order to respond to the continued market needs, it is therefore appropriate to open a further standing invitation to tender to make these stocks available for industrial use.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to fix a minimum quantity per tenderer or per lot.\n(5) To allow comparison of tender prices for sugar of different qualities, the tender price should refer to sugar of the standard quality as defined in Part B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(6) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(7) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a minimum selling price for each partial invitation to tender.\n(8) The minimum selling price refers to sugar of the standard quality. Provision should be made to adjust the selling price in cases where the sugar is not of this quality.\n(9) The quantities available for a Member State that can be awarded pursuant to this Regulation should take into account the quantities awarded pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 877/2008 of 9 September 2008 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden\u00a0(4).\n(10) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States to the Commission on the quantities actually sold.\n(11) The provisions on processor\u2019s records, checks and penalties laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota\u00a0(5) should apply to the quantities awarded under this Regulation.\n(12) To ensure that the quantities awarded pursuant to this Regulation are used as industrial sugar, financial penalties must be laid down for tenderers at a dissuasive level to avoid any risk of these quantities being used for other purposes.\n(13) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001\u00a0(6) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar pursuant to this Regulation.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden listed in Annex I shall offer for sale by standing invitation to tender for industrial use a maximum total quantity of 345\u00a0539 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention and available for sale for industrial use.\nThe maximum quantities involved per Member State are set out in Annex I.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The period during which tenders may be submitted in response to the first partial invitation to tender shall begin on 1 October 2008 and shall end on 15 October 2008 at 15.00 Brussels time.\nThe periods during which tenders may be submitted in response to the second and subsequent partial invitations shall begin on the first working day following the end of the preceding period.

In this context, the reference, in Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, to Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006\u00a0(7) shall be interpreted as a reference to Part B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The available quantity for a lot shall be reduced by the quantities awarded the same day for that lot by Regulation (EC) No 877/2008.\nWhere an award at a minimum selling price set pursuant to paragraph 1 would result in the available quantity for the Member State concerned being exceeded, that award shall be limited to such quantity as is still available.\nWhere awards for a Member State to all tenderers offering the same selling price would result in the quantity for that Member State being exceeded, then the quantity available shall be awarded as follows:\n(a) by division among the tenderers concerned in proportion of the total quantities in each of their tenders;\n(b) by apportionment among the tenderers concerned by reference to a maximum tonnage fixed for each of them; or\n(c) by drawing of lots.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the fifth working day at the latest after the Commission fixes the minimum selling price, the intervention agencies involved shall communicate to the Commission, according to the model set out in Annex III, the quantity actually sold by partial invitation to tender.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 11, 12 and 13 of Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 shall apply mutatis mutandis to processors in respect of the quantities of sugar awarded under this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the request of the successful tenderer, the competent authority of the Member State which granted his approval as processor within the meaning of Article 2(d) of Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 may permit a quantity, in white sugar equivalent, of sugar produced under quota to be used for the purposes of production of the products referred to in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 in place of the same quantity, in white sugar equivalent, of intervention sugar awarded. The competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall coordinate checks and monitoring of such an operation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each successful tenderer shall supply proof, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the Member State, that the quantity awarded by a partial invitation to tender has been used for the purposes of production of the products referred to in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 and in accordance with the approval referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 967/2006.
