This Directive shall apply to combined transport operations, without prejudice to Regulation (EEC) No 881/92 (5).\nFor the purposes of this Directive, 'combined transport' means the transport of goods between Member States where the lorry, trailer, semi-trailer, with or without tractor unit, swap body or container of 20 feet or more uses the road on the initial or  final leg of the journey and, on the other leg, rail or inland waterway or maritime services where this section exceeds 100 km as the crow flies and make the initial or final road transport leg of the journey;\n- between the point where the goods are loaded and the nearest suitable rail loading station for the initial leg, and between the nearest suitable rail unloading station and the point where the goods are unloaded for the final leg, or;\n- within a radius not exceeding 150 km as the crow flies from the inland waterway port or seaport of loading or unloading.", "Each of the Member States shall, by 1 July 1993, liberalize the combined transport operations referred to in Article 1 from all quota systems and systems of authorization.", "In the case of combined transport for hire or reward, a transport document which fulfils at least the requirements laid down in Article 6 of Council Regulation No 11 of 27 June 1960 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport  rates and conditions, in implementation of Article 79 (3) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (6), shall also specify the rail loading and unloading stations relating to the rail leg, or the inland waterway loading and unloading  ports relating to the inland waterway leg, or the maritime loading and unloading ports relating to the maritime section of the journey. These details shall be recorded before the transport operation is carried out and shall be confirmed by means of a  stamp affixed by the rail or port authorities in the railway stations or inland waterway or sea ports concerned when that part of the journey carried out by rail or inland waterway or by sea has been completed.", "All hauliers established in a Member State who meet the conditions of access to the occupation and access to the market for transport of goods between Member States shall have the right to carry out, in the context of a combined transport  operation between Member States, initial and/or final road haulage legs which form an integral part of the combined transport operation and which may or may not include the crossing of a frontier.", "1. Every two years and in the first instance by 1 July 1995 the Commission shall draw up a report to the Council on:\n- the economic development of combined transport,\n- the application of Community law in this area,\n- the definition, where necessary, of further measures to promote combined transport operations.\n2. When drawing up the report referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall be assisted by representatives of the Member State to collect the information necessary for this purpose.\nThe report shall analyze the information and statistics relating in particular to:\n- transport links used in combined transport operation,\n- the number of vehicles (a road train counting as a single vehicle), swap bodies and containers transported over the various transport links,\n- transported tonnages,\n- services carried out, in terms of tonnes/kilometres.\nThe report shall, where appropriate, propose solutions for the subsequent improvement of such information and the situation in the combined transport sector.", "1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the taxes listed in paragraph 3 which are applicable to road vehicles (lorries, tractors, trailers or semi-trailers) when routed in combined transport are reduced or reimbursed  either by a standard amount, or in proportion to the journeys that such vehicles undertake by rail, within limits and in accordance with conditions and rules they fix after consultation with the Commission.\nThe reductions of reimbursements referred to in the first paragraph shall be granted by the State in which the vehicles are registered, on the basis of the rail journeys effected within that State.\nMember States may, however, grant these reductions or reimbursements on the basis of the rail journeys which take place partially or wholly outside the Member State in which the vehicles are registered.\n2. Without prejudice to the provisions resulting from a possible reorganization of national taxation systems for commercial vehicles at Community level, vehicles used exclusively for road haulage in feeder or final delivery carriage by combined  transport may be exempted, if they are taxed separately, from the taxes listed in paragraph 3.\n3. The taxes referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are the following:\n- Belgium:\ntaxe de circulation sur les v\u00e9hicules automobiles/verkeersbelasting op de autovoertuigen;\n- Denmark:\nvaegtafgift af motorkoeretoejer mv.;\n- Germany:\nKraftfahrzeugsteuer;\n- France:\ntaxe sp\u00e9ciale sur certains v\u00e9hicules routiers;\n- Greece:\n\u00f4\u00dd\u00eb\u00e7 \u00ea\u00f5\u00ea\u00eb\u00efoe\u00ef\u00f1ss\u00e1\u00f2 \u00e1\u00f5\u00f4\u00ef\u00ea\u00e9\u00ed\u00de\u00f4\u00f9\u00ed;\n- Spain:\n(a) impuesto sobre actividades econ\u00f3micas,\n(b) impuesto sobre veh\u00edculos de tracci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica;\n- Ireland:\nvehicle excise duties;\n- Italy:\n(a) tassa automobilistica,\n(b) addizionale del 5 % sulla tassa automobilistica;\n- Luxembourg:\ntaxe sur les v\u00e9hicules automoteurs;\n- Netherlands:\nmotorrijtuigenbelasting;\n- Portugal:\n(a) imposto de camionagem,\n(b) imposto de circula\u00e7ao;\n- United Kingdom:\nvehicle excise duties.", "Where a trailer or semi-trailer belonging to an undertaking engaged in own-account transport is hauled on a final section by a tractor belonging to an undertaking engaged in transport for hire or reward, the transport operation so effected  shall be exempt from presentation of the document provided for in Article 3; however, another document shall be provided giving evidence of the journey covered or to be covered by rail, by inland waterway or by sea.", "Initial or final road haulage legs forming part of combined transport operations shall be exempted from compulsory tariff regulations.", "Where, as part of a combined transport operation, the dispatching undertaking carries out the initial road haulage leg for its own account within the meaning of the First Council Directive of 23 July 1962 on the establishment of common rules  for certain types of carriage of goods by road (7), the undertaking which is to receive the goods transported may, notwithstanding the definition given in the said Directive, carry out for its own account the final road haulage leg to transport the  goods to their destination using a tractor owned by it, bought by it on deferred terms or hired by it pursuant to Council Directive 84/647/EEC of 19 December 1984 on the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road (8), and  driven by its employees, even though the trailer or semi-trailer is registered or hired by the undertaking which dispatched the goods.\nThe initial road haulage leg in a combined transport operation which the dispatching undertaking carries out using a tractor owned by it, bought by it on deferred terms or hired by it pursuant to Directive 86/647/EEC and which is driven by its  employees, whereas the trailer or semi-trailer is registered or hired by the undertaking which is to receive the goods transported, shall also, notwithstanding the Directive of 23 July 1962, be considered an own-account carriage operation if the final  road haulage leg is carried out for its own account in accordance with the latter Directive by the recipient undertaking.", "0\n1.
