whereas, some of these substances were considered to be acceptable for addition to human foodstuffs and granted an E number, whereas, their administration to food producing animals as part of veterinary medicinal products is unlikely to result in residues in food of animal origin either significantly different from the additive or in concentrations exceeding those of the additive where it has been added directly to the food; whereas, based on the currently authorized use in veterinary practice, those substances approved as additives in foodstuffs for human consumption, with a valid E number, should be included in Annex II of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, rifaximin (applicable to bovine milk) should be inserted in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC\u00a0(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC\u00a0(4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 60th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 1996.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 269, 22. 10. 1996, p. 5.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 317, 6. 11. 1981, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 214, 24. 8. 1993, p. 31.\nANNEX\nRegulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is amended as follows:\nA.
