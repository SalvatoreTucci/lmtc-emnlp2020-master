Therefore Commission Directive 2004/104/EC\u00a0(3), which amended Directive 72/245/EEC, introduced references to the test procedures outlined in the recent editions of the relevant standards.\n(3) Since the entry into force of Directive 2004/104/EC, several standards have been replaced by more recent versions adapting them to technical progress. It is therefore necessary to update the references to those standards in Directive 72/245/EEC.\n(4) In addition, some editorial corrections need to be introduced.\n(5) Directive 72/245/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X to Directive 72/245/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30 September 2006 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
