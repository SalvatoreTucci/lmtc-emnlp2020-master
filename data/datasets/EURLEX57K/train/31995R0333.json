The level of the limit provided for in Article 11 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 shall be established taking into account the National Reference Area, the total area of eligible arable land and the objective of avoiding a level of  plantings which would give rise to excessive reductions in the crop specific oilseed compensatory payments.\n2. The limit and the criteria used to establish that limit shall be notified to the Commission at the earliest possible date and, at the latest, by 31 July of the marketing year prior to that in respect of which the compensatory payment is requested.\n3. The competent authority shall, in considering a producer's eligibility to receive the advance payment referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, determine whether the producer's application for support is within any limit  established. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2294/92 (2), any land for which the producer has requested the crop specific oilseed compensatory payment in excess of the limit shall be excluded from the  application.\n4. In cases where the exclusion of an area of land, under paragraph 3, would cause a producer's area of set-aside to exceed the limit referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 7 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 which applies in the Member  State, the area of set-aside land for which the producer has requested the compensatory payment shall be reduced accordingly.\n5. Any land excluded from producers' area aid applications under paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not be taken into consideration for the application of Article 2 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92.", "1.

For the 1995/96 marketing year, in cases where the competent authority informed producers of the application of the limit on or after 1 August 1994 but before sowing of winter rapeseed took place, the Member State is authorized to apply such limit in  the region in question, on the condition that the measures taken by that Member State were sufficient to prevent any producer having a legitimate expectation to receive crop-specific oilseeds compensation for an area greater than the limit established.\n3. Notwithstanding Article 1 (2), for the 1995/96 marketing year, the necessary information shall be supplied to the Commission by 28 February 1995.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 1995.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 February 1995.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 181, 1. 7. 1992, p. 12.\n(2) OJ No L 221, 6. 8. 1992, p. 22."}
