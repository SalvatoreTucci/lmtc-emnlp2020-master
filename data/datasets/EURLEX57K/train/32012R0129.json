Lactose content and density will no longer be determined as they do not affect the quality of the finished product and their analysis was based on a production method which no longer reflects the developments which have taken place on farms.\nHowever, the acidity of the milk is measured by determining the pH level and not in Dornic grades, and a change to this effect is being made in the specifications.\nAdditionally, as a result of technological progress made in the production industries, the process is carried out with a greater level of control in terms of the key parameters for final quality, and therefore the earlier version has become obsolete in terms of some of the stages of production.\nThe following part is being amended correspondingly:\nPart E \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obtaining the product\nAt the \u2018cutting of the curd\u2019 stage, the size of the curd grains obtained when the curd is cut is no longer specified, this being considered a criterion which each industry must establish depending on the process it uses. The curd must have the right consistency for ensuring correct draining in accordance with the type of cheese produced and this is not determined by specifying the exact size of the grain, but by means of checks carried out as part of the production system and the experience of the producer.\nThe \u2018pressing\u2019 stage includes the time needed for pressing, which in the current specification is included in the stage of removal from the mould, which is incorrect. A pressing time of between 1 and 6 hours is specified. This period of time for pressing has changed in relation to the time initially established as a result of the technological advances made in the pressing system, which no longer requires such long periods which have a negative effect on the smaller-sized product. This period is defined as being suitable for the various sizes of product and the various models of press and allows the operator to decide the best time for the product to be removed from the mould and to move to the salting stage, which will be determined not by the number of hours taken, but by measuring pH, which is the indicative value for the state of the product.\nThe \u2018maturation and preservation\u2019 stages have been combined into a single stage called \u2018maturation\u2019 and the preservation stage has been eliminated as maturation is not interrupted when the product is in the preservation chambers, in other words maturation continues throughout the product\u2019s lifetime and it continues to mature provided that it is kept at the right controlled temperature and relative humidity. Therefore the stages have been combined, with the temperature set at between 3\u00a0\u00b0C and 16\u00a0\u00b0C and the humidity between 75\u00a0% and 90\u00a0%.\nFor the temperature, the minimum value has been increased from 1\u00a0\u00b0C to 3\u00a0\u00b0C, which is a more suitable temperature for maintaining the product and guarantees the necessary health requirements, given that at 1\u00a0\u00b0C the product may deteriorate. As for the maximum value, 16\u00a0\u00b0C is given as a reference value in order to ensure the optimal maturation of the product and its development in terms of its organoleptic characteristics.\nThe humidity range is an overall value which covers the two stages.\nANNEX II\nSINGLE DOCUMENT\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 510/2006\n\u2018QUESO MANCHEGO\u2019\nEC No: ES-PDO-0217-0087-06.12.2010\nPGI ( ) PDO ( X )\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2018Queso Manchego\u2019\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member State\nSpain\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the agricultural product or foodstuff\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of Product\nClass 1.3.

When in the fold, their diet is supplemented with concentrated feed, hay and by-products.\nAs regards sheepfarming, mention should be made of the pastures that occupy the clearings in the scrub. This annual pasture is composed of Medicago minima, Scorpiurus subvillosa, Astragalus stella, Astragalus sesamus, etc.\nThe so-called \u2018madajales\u2019 are the most valuable pasture for sheep. These are composed of bulbous meadow grass and significant quantities of legumes, such as Medicago rigidula, Medicago lupulina, Medicago trunculata, Trigonella polyderata, Coronilla scorpoides, etc.\nDeep, cooler soils can produce \u2018fenelares\u2019, dense pasture with a predominance of perennial and biennial plants, the appearance of which is dominated by the grass Bracnypodium phoenicoides.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the identified geographical area\n\u2014\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\nCheeses protected by the \u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 Designation of Origin may be dispatched and placed into circulation by dairies and registered undertakings only in packaging of a type that does not affect their quality.\n\u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 is always marketed with the rind, which may have been washed.\n\u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 may also be coated in paraffin, covered with legally authorised inactive transparent substances or dipped in olive oil, provided that the rind maintains its natural colour and appearance and the casein label can be read.\nUnder no circumstances may substances be used that turn the rind black.\n\u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 may be marketed in portions, sliced or grated, provided that it is packaged and its origin can be identified. This operation may be carried out outside the area of origin by undertakings that have accepted and comply with the agreed protocol so as to guarantee the operations undergone by \u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 and ensure its traceability.\nPackaging must comply with current legislation.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nLabels must bear the following wording: \u2018Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen \u201cQueso Manchego\u201d\u00a0\u2019 (\u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 Designation of Origin). When the cheese is made with raw milk, this can be indicated on the label by means of the word \u2018Artesano\u2019.\nThe marketed product bears a numbered secondary label issued by the Regulatory Board and affixed in registered undertakings in such a way that it cannot be reused and every piece of \u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 has on one of its faces a casein label with a serial number, affixed at the moulding and pressing stage.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe following local authority areas are covered by the \u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 Designation of Origin: 45 in the Province of Albacete, 84 in the Province of Ciudad Real, 156 in the Province of Cuenca and 122 in the Province of Toledo.\nThe following areas have been incorporated: Alcoba de los Montes and El Robledo in the Province of Ciudad Real, Albadalejo del Cuende, Villarejo de la Pe\u00f1uela, Villarejo-Sobrehuerta and Villar del Horno in the Province of Cuenca.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe geographical area of La Mancha is located in the southern part of the central plateau of the peninsula and is characterised by a low relief descending to the Atlantic.\nLa Mancha is a high plain with lime-clay soils and its pastureland has lime- and loam-rich substrates.\nThe area has an extreme climate and experiences wide variations characteristic of a continental climate, with very cold winters and hot summers. The temperature occasionally reaches 40\u00a0\u00b0C, sometimes varying by 20\u00a0\u00b0C over the course of a day and 50\u00a0\u00b0C over the year. Precipitation is scant, making the region one of the more arid areas of Spain, its extremely dry environment having a relative humidity of around 65\u00a0%.\nThe Manchega breed is the best adapted to the area\u2019s soil and weather conditions.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nA pressed cheese with a hard rind and a firm and compact paste, a colour that varies from white to ivory-yellow, an intense and persistent aroma, a slightly acidic, strong and flavoursome taste and a buttery, slightly floury texture with low elasticity.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe area\u2019s soil and climatic conditions have had a great influence on the processes of natural selection that have made the Manchega breed of sheep the breed best adapted to the area and producing a milk that gives \u2018Queso Manchego\u2019 its characteristic colour, aroma, flavour and texture.\nCheese has been made with milk from ewes of the Manchega breed since time immemorial and over the centuries manufacturing techniques have aimed to optimise the qualities of this traditional La Mancha cheese.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\nhttp://docm.jccm.es/portaldocm/descargarArchivo.do?ruta=2009/10/20/pdf/2010_17415.pdf&tipo=rutaDocm"}
