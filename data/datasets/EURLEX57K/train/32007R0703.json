Following examination of an application for the extension to rabbits of the existing entry for Dihydrostreptomycin, it is considered appropriate to modify the entry for Dihydrostreptomycin to include rabbits.\n(3) The substance Streptomycin is included in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for bovine and ovine for muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk as well as for porcine for muscle, skin and fat, liver and kidney. Following examination of the application for the extension to rabbits of the existing entry for Dihydrostreptomycin and taking account that the safety evaluation of the above referred two substances had been initially carried out together on the basis of their similarity in chemical structure and biological activity, it is also considered appropriate to modify the entry for Streptomycin to include rabbits for muscle, fat, liver and kidney. It was equally considered appropriate to modify the current entry of Streptomycin for bovine and ovine by a new entry for all ruminants for muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) An adequate period should be allowed before the applicability of this Regulation in order to enable Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary in the light of this Regulation to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(2) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 21 August 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 June 2007.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.
