According to Article 3(4) of the Directive, the conformity of secure signature-creation-devices with the requirements laid down in Annex III shall be determined by appropriate public or private bodies designated by Member States and the Commission shall establish criteria for Member States to determine whether a body should be designated for performing such conformity assessments.\n(3) The establishment of the above criteria by the Commission has to be made after consultation of the \"Electronic Signature Committee\" set up under Article 9(1) of Directive 1999/93/EC.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the \"Electronic Signature Committee\",", "main_body": ["The purpose of this Decision is to establish the criteria for Member States to determine whether a national body should be designated as responsible for the conformity assessments of secure signature-creation-devices.", "Where a designated body is part of an organisation involved in activities other than conformance assessment of secure signature-creation-devices with the requirements laid down in Annex III to Directive 1999/93/EC it must be identifiable within that organisation. Different activities must be clearly distinguished.", "The body and its staff must not engage in any activities that may conflict with their independence of judgement and integrity in relation to their task. In particular, the body must be independent of the parties involved. Therefore, the body, its executive officer and the staff responsible for carrying out the conformance assessment tasks must not be a designer, manufacturer, supplier or installer of secure signature-creation-devices, or a certification service provider issuing certificates to the public, nor the authorised representative of any of such parties.\nIn addition, they must be financially independent and not become directly involved in the design, construction, marketing or maintenance of secure signature-creation-devices, nor represent the parties engaged in these activities. This does not preclude the possibility of exchange of technical information between the manufacturer and the designated body.", "The body and its personnel must be able to determine the conformity of secure signature-creation-devices with the requirements laid down in Annex III to Directive 1999/93/EC with a high degree of professional integrity, reliability and sufficient technical competence.", "The body shall be transparent in its conformity assessment practices and shall record all relevant information concerning these practices.

The designated body must take full responsibility for the work carried out under those arrangements. The final decision remains with the designated body.", "2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2000.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 13, 19.1.2000, p. 12."}
