Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.\n(7) The comments from the applicant and the members of the public received by the Commission, pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.\n(8) Health claims referred to in Article 13(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 are subject to the transition measures laid down in Article 28(5) of that Regulation only if they comply with the conditions therein mentioned, among which that they have to comply with the Regulation. As for the claim subject to the present Regulation, the Authority concluded that a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of the food and the claimed effect and thus it does not comply with the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and it could not benefit from the transition period foreseen in Article 28(5) of that Regulation.
