Article 51 of that Regulation provides that the Commission may organise training courses for the staff of the competent authorities of Member States responsible for the official controls referred to in that Regulation, which may be opened to participants from third countries, in particular developing countries. Those courses may include, in particular, training on European Union feed and food law and animal health and animal welfare rules.\n(2) Article 2(1)(i) of Directive 2000/29/EC provides the legal basis for organising courses in the field of plant health.\n(3) The \u2018Better Training for Safer Food\u2019 Programme has been established in 2006 by the Commission in order to achieve the aims set out in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. The Commission Communication of 20 September 2006 on \u2018Better training for safer food\u2019\u00a0(6) explores options for future organisation of training.\n(4) In order to ensure implementation of the \u2018Better Training for Safer Food\u2019 Programme in Member States it is necessary to adopt a financing decision and the work programme on training in the field of food and feed safety, animal health, animal welfare and plant health for 2014.

This Decision entrusts the Agency with certain management and programme implementation tasks relating to the food safety training measures performed pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and Directive 2000/29/EC. A Union financial contribution should therefore be granted to the Agency in 2014 for financing the operating costs of the activities related to the \u2018Better Training for Safer Food\u2019 Programme.\n(6) For the application of this Decision, it is appropriate to define the term \u2018substantial change\u2019, within the meaning of Article 94(4) of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012.\n(7) This Decision should allow for the payment of interest due for late payment on the basis of Article 92 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 and Article 111(4) of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012,", "main_body": ["The annual work programme for the implementation of the Better Training for Safer Food Programme for 2014, as set out in the Annex, is adopted.
