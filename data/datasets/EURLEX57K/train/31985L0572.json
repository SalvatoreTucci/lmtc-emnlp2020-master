In the following tables, which make up a non-exhaustive list of foodstuffs, the simulants to be used in migration tests with a particular foodstuff or group of foodstuffs are identified by the letters shown:\n2. For each foodstuff or group of foodstuffs, only the simulant(s) indicated by an \u2018X\u2019 is (are) to be used, using for each simulant, a new sample of the materials and subject concerned. Where no \u2018X\u2019 appears, no migration test is required for the heading or subheading concerned.\n3. When \u2018X\u2019 is followed by an oblique stroke and a figure, the result of the migration tests should be divided by the number indicated. In the case of certain types of fatty foodstuffs this figure, known as the \u2018reduction factor\u2019, is conventionally used to take account of the greater extractive capacity of the simulant for such foodstuffs.\n4. Where the letter \u2018a\u2019 is shown in brackets after the \u2018X\u2019, only one of the two simulants given should be used:\n\u2014 if the pH value of the foodstuff is higher than 4,5, simulant A should be used,\n\u2014 if the pH value of the foodstuff is 4,5, or less, simulant B should be used.\n5. Where a foodstuff is listed under both a specific and a general heading, only the simulant(s) indicated under the specific heading is (are) to be used.\nTABLE\nReference number Description of foodstuffs Simulants to be used\nA B C D\n01 Beverages\n01.01 Non-alcoholic beverages or alcoholic beverages of an alcoholic strength lower than 5 % vol.:\nWaters, ciders, fruit or vegetable juices of normal strength or concentrated, musts, fruit nectars, lemonades and mineral waters, syrups, bitters, infusions, coffee, tea, liquid chocolate, beers and other X(a) X(a)\n01.02 Alcoholic beverages of an alcoholic strength equal to or exceeding 5 % vol.:\nBeverages shown under heading 01.01 but with an alcoholic strength equal to or exceeding 5 % vol.:\nWines, spirits and liqueurs  X\u00a0(4) X\u00a0(5)\n01.03 Miscellaneous: undenatured ethyl aclcohol  X\u00a0(4) X\u00a0(5)\n02 Cereals, cereal products, pastry, biscuits, cakes and other bakers' wares\n02.01 Starches\n02.02 Cereals, unprocessed, puffed, in flakes, (including popcorn, corn flakes and the like)\n02.03 Cereal flour and meal\n02.04 Macaroni, spaghetti and similar products\n02.05 Pastry, biscuits, cakes and, other bakers' wares, dry:\nA.
