Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs\u00a0(3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption\u00a0(4).\n(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1058/2011\u00a0(5). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.\n(6) In order to prevent divergence with the current market situation, to prevent market speculation and to ensure efficient management this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Export refunds as provided for in Article 164 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be granted on the products and for the amounts set out in the Annex to this Regulation subject to the condition provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The products eligible for a refund under paragraph 1 shall meet the relevant requirements of Regulations (EC) No 852/2004 and (EC) No 853/2004 and, in particular, shall be prepared in an approved establishment and comply with the health marking requirements laid down in Annex I, Section I, Chapter III to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004.", "Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1058/2011 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 January 2012.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nJos\u00e9 Manuel SILVA RODR\u00cdGUEZ\nDirector-General for Agriculture and Rural Development\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 206.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 276, 21.10.2011, p. 35.\nANNEX\nExport refunds on pigmeat applicable from 20 January 2012\nProduct code Destination Unit of measurement Amount of refund\n0210\u00a011\u00a031\u00a09110 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 54,20\n0210\u00a011\u00a031\u00a09910 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 54,20\n0210\u00a019\u00a081\u00a09100 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 54,20\n0210\u00a019\u00a081\u00a09300 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 54,20\n1601\u00a000\u00a091\u00a09120 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 19,50\n1601\u00a000\u00a099\u00a09110 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 15,20\n1602\u00a041\u00a010\u00a09110 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 29,00\n1602\u00a041\u00a010\u00a09130 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 17,10\n1602\u00a042\u00a010\u00a09110 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 22,80\n1602\u00a042\u00a010\u00a09130 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 17,10\n1602\u00a049\u00a019\u00a09130 A00 EUR/100\u00a0kg 17,10\nNB: The product codes and the \u2018A\u2019 series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1)."}
