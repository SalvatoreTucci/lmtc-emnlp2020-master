The International Vine and Wine Office (OIV) adopted the new description of this method at its General Assembly in 2003.\n(2) Using this method will ensure simpler, more precise monitoring of excess pressure in these wines.\n(3) The description of the usual method in Chapter 37 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90\u00a0(2) is no longer necessary and paragraph 3 of Chapter 37 should therefore be deleted. The updated description of this method should, moreover, be introduced in a new chapter of the Annex to that Regulation.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 should therefore be amended accordingly,\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 is hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.

Regulation last amended by Regulation (EC) No 355/2005 (OJ L 56, 2.3.2005, p. 3).\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. Chapter \u201837. Carbon Dioxide\u2019 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 1 is amended as follows:\n(i) the title is replaced by the following: \u20181. PRINCIPLE OF THE METHOD\u2019;\n(ii) point 1.2 is deleted;\n(b) in paragraph 2, the title of point 2.3 is replaced by the following title: \u2018Calculation of the theoretical excess pressure\u2019;\n(c) paragraphs 3 and 4 are deleted;\n2. after Chapter 37, the following text is inserted as Chapter 37a:\n\u2014 the top part (a screw needle holder) is made up of a manometer, a manual tightening ring, an endless screw, which slips into the middle part, and a needle, which goes through the capsule. The needle has a lateral hole that transmits pressure to the manometer. A joint ensures that it is tightly sealed onto the capsule of the bottle,\n\u2014 the middle part (or the nut) permits the centring of the top part. It is screwed into the lower part, holding the entire apparatus firmly onto the bottle,\n\u2014 the lower part (clamp) is equipped with a spur that slips under the ring of the bottle, holding the entire apparatus together. There are rings adapted to fit every kind of bottle.\n\u2014 the top part is identical to the previous apparatus, but the needle is longer. It is made up of a long empty tube with a point on one end to help insert the needle through the cork. This point is detachable and falls into the wine once the cork has been pierced,\n\u2014 the lower part is made up of a nut and a base sitting on the stopper. This is equipped with four tightening screws used to keep the whole apparatus on the stopper.\n\u2014 they can be either mechanical Bourdon tube-type devices or digital piezoelectric sensors. In the first case, the Bourdon tube must be made of stainless steel,\n\u2014 they are graduated in pascals (Pa). For sparkling wine, it is more practical to use 105 pascals (105 Pa) or kilopascals (kPa) as the unit of measurement,\n\u2014 they can be from different classes. The class of a manometer is the precision of a reading compared to a full-scale reading expressed as a percentage (e.g. manometer 1\u00a0000\u00a0kPa class 1 signifies the maximum useable pressure 1\u00a0000 kPa, reading at \u00b1\u00a010 kPa). Class 1 is recommended for precise measurements.\n\u00b0C\n0 1,85\n1 1,80\n2 1,74\n3 1,68\n4 1,64\n5 1,59\n6 1,54\n7 1,50\n8 1,45\n9 1,40\n10 1,36\n11 1,32\n12 1,28\n13 1,24\n14 1,20\n15 1,16\n16 1,13\n17 1,09\n18 1,06\n19 1,03\n20 1,00\n21 0,97\n22 0,95\n23 0,93\n24 0,91\n25 0,88"}
