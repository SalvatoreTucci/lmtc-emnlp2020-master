The NCBs of the existing participating Member States have paid up their subscriptions to the ECB's capital in full\u00a0(3). Banka Slovenije's weighting in the ECB's capital key is 0,3194\u00a0%, pursuant to Article 2 of Decision ECB/2006/21 of 15 December 2006 on the national central banks\u2019 percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank's capital\u00a0(4). Banka Slovenije has already paid up a share of its subscription to the ECB's capital, pursuant to Article 1 of Decision ECB/2004/10 of 23 April 2004 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the non-participating national central banks\u00a0(5). The outstanding amount is therefore EUR 17\u00a0096\u00a0556,47, which results from multiplying the ECB's subscribed capital (EUR 5\u00a0760\u00a0652\u00a0402,58) by Banka Slovenije's capital key weighting (0,3194\u00a0%), minus the share of its subscription that has already been paid up, thereby taking into account the expansion of the ECB's capital key as a result of the Bulgarian National Bank and Banca Na\u0163ional\u0103 a Rom\u00e2niei joining the ESCB.\n(3) Article 49.1, in conjunction with Article 30.1, of the Statute provides that the NCB of a Member State whose derogation has been abrogated must also transfer foreign reserve assets to the ECB. Pursuant to Article 49.1 of the Statute, the sum to be transferred is determined by multiplying the euro value at current exchange rates of the foreign reserve assets which have already been transferred to the ECB in accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statute, by the ratio between the number of shares subscribed by the NCB concerned and the number of shares already paid up by the NCBs of the other participating Member States. When determining the \u2018foreign reserve assets which have already been transferred to the ECB in accordance with Article 30.1\u2019, due account should be taken of the ECB capital key adjustment on 1 January 2004\u00a0(6) pursuant to Article 29.3 of the Statute, the ECB capital key expansion on 1 May 2004\u00a0(7) pursuant to Article 49.3 of the Statute, and the ECB's capital key expansion on 1 January 2007 pursuant to Article 49.3 of the Statute\u00a0(8). As a result, pursuant to Decision ECB/2006/24 of 15 December 2006 laying down the measures necessary for the contribution to the European Central Bank's accumulated equity value, for adjusting the national central banks\u2019 claims equivalent to the transferred foreign reserve assets\u00a0(9), the euro equivalent of the foreign reserve assets which have already been transferred to the ECB under Article 30.1 of the Statute is EUR 41\u00a0514\u00a0271\u00a0945,60.\n(4) The foreign reserve assets to be transferred by Banka Slovenije should be denominated in US dollars and gold.\n(5) Article 30.3 of the Statute provides that the ECB must credit each NCB of a participating Member State with a claim equivalent to the foreign reserve assets that it has transferred to the ECB. The provisions regarding the denomination and remuneration of the claims that have already been credited to the NCBs of the existing participating Member States\u00a0(10) should also apply to the denomination and remuneration of Banka Slovenije's claim.\n(6) Article 49.2 of the Statute provides that the NCB of a Member State whose derogation has been abrogated must contribute to the ECB's reserves, to those provisions equivalent to reserves, and to the amount still to be appropriated to the reserves and provisions corresponding to the balance of the profit and loss account as at 31 December of the year prior to abrogation of the derogation. The amount of this contribution is determined in accordance with Article 49.2 of the Statute.\n(7) In accordance with Article 3.5 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, the Governor of Banka Slovenije has been invited to attend the meeting of the Governing Council adopting this Decision,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision:\n\u2014 \u2018participating Member State\u2019 means a Member State that has adopted the euro,\n\u2014 \u2018cash\u2019 means the lawful currency of the United States (US dollar),\n\u2014 \u2018gold\u2019 means fine troy ounces of gold in the form of London Good Delivery bars, as specified by the London Bullion Market Association,\n\u2014 \u2018foreign reserve assets\u2019 means gold or cash.", "Payment of capital\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 January 2007, Banka Slovenije shall pay up the remaining share of its subscription to the ECB's capital, which corresponds to EUR 17\u00a0096\u00a0556,47.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Banka Slovenije shall pay this amount to the ECB on 2 January 2007 by means of a transfer through the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system (Target).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Banka Slovenije shall, by means of a separate Target transfer, pay to the ECB on 2 January 2007 the interest accruing during the period from 1 January 2007 until 2 January 2007 on the amount due to the ECB under paragraph 2.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any interest accruing under paragraph 3 shall be calculated on a daily basis, using the actual over-360-day method of calculation, at a rate equal to the marginal interest rate used by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in that of its most recent main refinancing operation.", "Transfer of foreign reserve assets\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Banka Slovenije shall transfer to the ECB, with effect from 1 January 2007 and in accordance with this Article and the arrangements taken pursuant to it, an amount of foreign reserve assets denominated in US dollars and gold that is equivalent to EUR 191\u00a0641\u00a0809,33, as follows:\nEuro-equivalent amount of US dollars Euro-equivalent amount of gold Aggregate euro-equivalent amount\n162\u00a0895\u00a0537,93 28\u00a0746\u00a0271,40 191\u00a0641\u00a0809,33\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The euro-equivalent amounts of foreign reserve assets to be transferred by Banka Slovenije under paragraph 1 shall be calculated on the basis of the exchange rates between the euro and the US dollar established as a result of the 24-hour written consultation procedure on 29 December 2006 between those central banks that participate in that procedure and, in the case of gold, on the basis of the US dollar price of gold per fine troy ounce established in the London gold fixing at 10.30 a.m., London time, on 29 December 2006.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ECB shall confirm to Banka Slovenije as soon as possible the amounts calculated in accordance with paragraph 2.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Banka Slovenije shall transfer cash to the ECB to such accounts as are specified by the ECB.
