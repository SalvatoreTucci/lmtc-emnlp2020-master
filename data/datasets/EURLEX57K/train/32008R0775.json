For the categories covered by Directive 2003/7/EC, that Directive replaced the conditions of authorisation provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a02316/98\u00a0(3). That additive was entered in the Community Register of Feed Additives as an existing product in accordance with Article\u00a010 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(2) On a request by the Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) adopted an opinion on 14\u00a0June 2007 on maximum residue limits (MRLs) for canthaxanthin in foodstuffs coming from animals\u00a0(4). To respect the acceptable daily intake of canthaxanthin, the Authority proposed to set MRLs for that substance according to the values given in that opinion.\n(3) MRLs should therefore be established accordingly for the feed additive canthaxanthin in addition to the existing authorisation conditions of this additive.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For canthaxanthin, in addition to the conditions of authorisation provided for in Directive 2003/7/EC, maximum residue limits shall apply as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 August 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
