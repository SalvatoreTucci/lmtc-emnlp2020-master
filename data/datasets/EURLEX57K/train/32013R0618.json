An entry concerning those consignments should therefore be included in the list.\n(5) The list should also be amended by increasing the frequency of official controls for the commodities for which the same sources of information show a higher degree of non-compliance with the relevant Union legislation thereby warranting an increased level of official controls. The entry in the list concerning Brassica oleracea from China should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Similarly, the list should be amended by decreasing the frequency of official controls for commodities for which the available information indicates an overall improvement in the degree of compliance with the relevant Union legislation and for which the current level of official controls is therefore no longer justified. The entry in the list concerning Brassica vegetables from Thailand should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) In addition, the list should be amended by deleting the entries for commodities for which the available information indicates an overall satisfactory degree of compliance with the relevant safety requirements provided for in Union legislation and for which an increased level of official controls is therefore no longer justified. The entries in the list concerning groundnuts from South Africa and pomegranates from Egypt should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) In the interest of clarity, it is necessary to amend the list of pesticide residues in the endnotes set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 in order to ensure that they are consistent with the definition provided for in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC\u00a0(3).\n(9) In order to ensure consistency and clarity, it is appropriate to replace Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 June 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 165, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 25.7.2009, p. 11.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 70, 16.3.2005, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nFeed and food of non-animal origin subject to an increased level of official controls at the designated point of entry\nFeed and food CN code\u00a0(1) TARIC sub-division Country of origin Hazard Frequency of physical and identity checks\nDried grapes (vine fruit) 0806\u00a020  Afghanistan (AF) Ochratoxin A 50\n(Food)\nHazelnuts 0802\u00a021\u00a000;
