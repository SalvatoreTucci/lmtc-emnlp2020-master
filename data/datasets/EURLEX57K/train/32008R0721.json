That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns authorisation of preparation of dried killed cells of red carotenoid-rich bacterium Paracoccus carotinifaciens (NITE SD 00017) as a feed additive for salmon and trout, to be classified in the additive category \u2018sensory additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 18 September 2007 that that preparation of dried killed cells of red carotenoid-rich bacterium Paracoccus carotinifaciens (NITE SD 00017) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that it favourably affects the characteristics of animal products\u00a0(2). It further concluded that that preparation does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. The Authority made a recommendation concerning maximum residue limits. It did not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018sensory additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018a (ii).
