Previous action\n(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 3617/90 (2) the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in Turkey or Venezuela, and accepted undertakings offered by major exporters in  connection with such imports.\nB. Subsequent procedure\n(2) Having been informed of the main conclusions of the preliminary investigation, none of the parties concerned made known its views in writing or applied to be heard by the Commission within the period specified in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No  3617/90.\nC. Dumping\n(3) As no new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duties in respect of imports originating in Turkey and Venezuela, the findings on dumping with regard to Turkey and Venezuela, as set out in Regulation (EEC) No  3617/90, are therefore considered to be definitive.\nD. Injury\n(4) With regard to injury, as no new evidence has been received since the imposition of the provisional duties in respect of imports originating in Turkey and Venezuela, the findings as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 3617/90 are therefore confirmed.\nE. Community interest\n(5) No observations were received from any user of welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, imported from Turkey and Venezuela, and subject to provisional anti-dumping duties within the time limit laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 3617/90.\n(6) The Commission's conclusion, that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken, is therefore confirmed. Under these circumstances, in order to minimize the risk of circumvention of the anti-dumping measures, protection of the Community's  interest calls for the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of certain welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in Turkey and Venezuela.\nF. Rate of duty\n(7) The provisional anti-dumping duties were calculated as being adequate to remove the injury to the Community industry. The provisional findings of the Commission having been confirmed, the amounts of the definitive anti-dumping duties should be the  same as the amounts of the provisional duties.\nG. Undertakings\n(8) The Turkish and Venezuelan producers/exporters which cooperated during the investigation, having been informed of the preliminary findings of the Commission services with regard to dumping and injury, offered price undertakings which, after  consultation within the Advisory Committee, have been accepted under Regulation (EEC) No 3617/90.\nH. Collection of provisional duty\n(9) In view of the high level of the dumping margins found and the seriousness of the injury caused to Community producers, it is considered necessary that amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty should be collected in full.\nI. Consultation\n(10) The advisory committee has been consulted with regard to this course of action and has raised no objection to the proposals.", "main_body": ["  Article 1\n1.
