To prevent the introduction of these pests into the EU, protection measures on importation of live bees have been laid down by Decision 2003/881/EC.\n(3) Given the characteristics of these diseases and the absence of an OIE. compulsory notification standard for them, the importation requirements of live queen bees into the EU provide for a declaration of notifiablity of the small hive beetle and Tropilaelaps mite throughout the territory of the exporting third country. The USA competent authority (APHIS-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) has informed the Commission services that this is not the case in all the USA States. For this reason, they asked the Commission to provide a derogation authorising the exportation of live queen bees from Hawaii, that is geographically separated from all the other States of the Union, and where the diseases are notifiable.\n(4) The USA competent authority has transmitted all the necessary information as regards the animal health situation of bees in Hawaii, highlighting that no bees have been imported into their territory since 1985 and survey programs for detection of bee diseases including the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) and Tropilaelaps mite (Tropilaelaps spp.) are carried out routinely.\n(5) Taking account of the particular geographical situation of Hawaii and its health status as regards bee diseases, a regionalisation mechanism for isolated territories should be established allowing for appropriate derogations, and such a derogation should be granted to Hawaii in order to allow the importation of live queen bees and live queen bumble bees exclusively from that part of the USA.\n(6) Article 1 and the Annexes to Commission Decision 2003/881/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Commission Decision 2003/881/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
