More guidance for testing poorly-soluble substances is given in ISO 10634. However, an additional test method should be introduced for use with surfactants that are poorly-soluble in water. The additional test method proposed is ISO standard 10708:1997 \u2018Water quality \u2014 Evaluation in an aqueous medium of the ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds\u2019. The Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) concluded that ISO 10708 is of an equivalent standard to the test methods already included in Annex III to that Regulation and was in favour of its use.\n(3) To ensure a high level of health protection, information concerning detergent composition needs to be made more easily available to the general public. The address of a website should therefore be provided on the packaging of the detergent from which the list of ingredients mentioned in Section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 can be easily obtained.\n(4) There is a requirement to declare allergenic fragrances if they are added in the form of pure substances. However there is no requirement to declare them if they are added as constituents of complex ingredients such as essential oils or perfumes. To ensure better transparency to the consumer, allergenic fragrances in detergents should be declared irrespective of the way they are added to the detergent.\n(5) The list of ingredients intended for the general public that is given in section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 requires the use of specialised scientific nomenclature that may hinder rather than help the general public. Moreover, there are some minor inconsistencies between the information made available to the general public compared to that to be made available to medical personnel under section C of the same Annex. The ingredient information for the general public should be made more easily understandable by using the INCI nomenclature already in use for cosmetic ingredients, and sections C and D should be made compatible.\n(6) The definition of \u2018detergent\u2019 in the Regulation makes it clear that the rules on labelling apply to all detergents whether they contain surfactants or not. However, section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 lays down different rules for those industrial and institutional detergents that contain surfactants compared with those that do not. This difference in labelling requirements serves no useful purpose and should be eliminated.\n(7) Annexes III and VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 should be amended accordingly. In the interest of clarity it is appropriate to replace those Annexes.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the detergents Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.

The reference method for laboratory testing of surfactant ultimate biodegradability in this Regulation is based on the EN ISO standard 14593: 1999 (CO2 headspace test).\n1. EN ISO Standard 14593: 1999 \u2014 Water quality \u2014 Evaluation of ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds in aqueous medium \u2014 Method by analysis of inorganic carbon in sealed vessels (CO2 headspace test). Pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied (reference method).\n2. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-C (carbon dioxide (CO2) Eeolution modified Sturm test): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied.\n3. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-E (closed Bottle): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied.\n4. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-D (manometric respirometry): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied.\n5. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-F (MITI: Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied.\n6. ISO 10708:1997 \u2014 Water quality \u2014 Evaluation in an aqueous medium of the ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds \u2014 Determination of biochemical oxygen demand in a two-phase closed bottle test. Pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied.\nB. Depending on the physical characteristics of the surfactant, one of the methods listed below may be used if appropriately justified\u00a0(2). It should be noted that the pass criterion of at least 70\u00a0% of these methods is to be considered as equivalent to the pass criterion of at least 60\u00a0% referred to in methods listed in point A. The adequacy of the choice of the methods listed below shall be decided on a case-by-case confirmation, in accordance with Article 5 of this Regulation.\n1. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-A (dissolved organic carbon DOC die-away): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied. The pass criteria for biodegradability measured according to the test shall be at least 70\u00a0% within 28 days.\n2. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-B (modified OECD screening-DOC die-away): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied. The pass criteria for biodegradability measured according to the test shall be at least 70\u00a0% within 28 days.\nNB: Those of the abovementioned methods that are taken from Council Directive 67/548/EEC can also be found in the publication \u201cClassification, Packaging and Labelling of Dangerous Substances in the European Union\u201d, Part 2: \u201cTesting Methods\u201d. European Commission 1997, ISBN 92-828-0076-8.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0These tests are identified as the most suitable for surfactants.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The DOC methods could give results on the removal and not on the ultimate biodegradation. The manometric respirometry and the MITI and two-phase BOD methods would not be appropriate in some cases because the high initial test concentration could be inhibitory.\u2019\nANNEX II\n\u2018ANNEX VII\nLABELLING AND INGREDIENT DATA SHEET\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling of contents\nThe following provisions on labelling shall apply to the packaging of detergents sold to the general public.\nThe following weight percentage ranges:\n\u2014 less than 5\u00a0%,\n\u2014 5\u00a0% or over but less than 15\u00a0%,\n\u2014 15\u00a0% or over but less than 30\u00a0%,\n\u2014 30\u00a0% and more,\nshall be used to indicate the content of the constituents listed below where they are added in a concentration above 0,2\u00a0% by weight:\n\u2014 phosphates,\n\u2014 phosphonates,\n\u2014 anionic surfactants,\n\u2014 cationic surfactants,\n\u2014 amphoteric surfactants,\n\u2014 non-ionic surfactants,\n\u2014 oxygen-based bleaching agents,\n\u2014 chlorine-based bleaching agents,\n\u2014 EDTA and salts thereof,\n\u2014 NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) and salts thereof,\n\u2014 phenols and halogenated phenols,\n\u2014 paradichlorobenzene,\n\u2014 aromatic hydrocarbons,\n\u2014 aliphatic hydrocarbons,\n\u2014 halogenated hydrocarbons,\n\u2014 soap,\n\u2014 zeolites,\n\u2014 polycarboxylates.\nThe following classes of constituent, if added, shall be listed irrespective of their concentration:\n\u2014 enzymes,\n\u2014 disinfectants,\n\u2014 optical brighteners,\n\u2014 perfumes.\nIf added, preservation agents shall be listed, irrespective of their concentration, using where possible the common nomenclature established under Article 8 of Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products\u00a0(1).\nIf added at concentrations exceeding 0,01\u00a0% by weight, the allergenic fragrances that appear on the list of substances in Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC, as a result of its amendment by Directive 2003/15/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) to include the allergenic perfume ingredients from the list first established by the Scientific Committee on Cosmetics and Non-food Products (SCCNFP) in its opinion SCCNFP/0017/98, shall be listed using the nomenclature of that Directive, as shall any other allergenic fragrances that are subsequently added to Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC by adaptation of that Annex to technical progress.\nIf individual risk-based concentration limits for fragrance allergens are subsequently established by the SCCNFP, the Commission shall propose the adoption, in accordance with Article 12(2), of such limits to replace the limit of 0,01\u00a0% mentioned above.\nThe website address, from which the list of ingredients mentioned in section D of Annex VII can be obtained, shall be given on the packaging.\nFor detergents intended to be used in the industrial and institutional sector, and not made available to members of the general public, the abovementioned requirements do not have to be fulfilled if the equivalent information is provided by means of technical data sheets, safety data sheets, or in a similar appropriate manner.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling of dosage information\nAs prescribed in Article 11(4), the following provisions on labelling shall apply to the packaging of detergents sold to the general public.
