The control of this disease in organic production is difficult and requires the use of copper, the use of which can be reduced by applying calcium hydroxide.\n(4) Ethylene is already included in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 as a substance of traditional use in organic farming. It has appeared appropriate to complete the conditions for use of that substance in order to cover, besides bananas, certain other fruits for which ethylene is needed in the production.\n(5) Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p. 1.
