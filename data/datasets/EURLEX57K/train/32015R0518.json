That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, and by the relevant data to support that amendment request.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation of Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 as a feed additive for chickens reared for laying, minor poultry species for fattening and minor poultry species reared for laying, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and the modification of the terms of the current authorisation for chickens for fattening to allow simultaneous use with the additional coccidiostats lasalocid A sodium, maduramycin ammonium, narasin, narasin/nicarbazin and salinomycin sodium.\n(4) The use of that preparation was authorised for 10\u00a0years for chickens for fattening by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 361/2011 and for calves, kids, cats and dogs by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1061/2013\u00a0(3).\n(5) The preparation was also authorised without time limit in accordance with Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(4) for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005\u00a0(5), for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a0252/2006\u00a0(6), for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 943/2005\u00a0(7).\n(6) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 30 October 2014\u00a0(8) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health and the environment. Since the potential of the additive to be efficacious has been demonstrated in chickens for fattening, this conclusion is extended to chickens reared for laying. This conclusion can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening and for laying. The Authority also concluded that the additive is compatible with lasalocid A sodium, maduramycin ammonium, narasin, narasin/nicarbazin and salinomycin sodium. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(7) The assessment of the preparation of Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(8) In order to allow for the use of coccidiostats compatible with the preparation of Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 also for chickens for fattening it is appropriate to amend Implementing Regulation (EU) No 361/2011.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "In the ninth column, \u2018Other provisions\u2019, of Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 361/2011, point 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.
