The form to be used should contain a number of fields that are sufficiently diversified, so as to allow Member States to easily deal with all relevant cases, using the fields appropriate for each case.\n(3) According to Directive 2011/16/EU, the information should be communicated using the Common Communication Network (CCN) as far as possible.
