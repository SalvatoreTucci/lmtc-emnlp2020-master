APPLICATION FOR EC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL\n1.1. The application for EC component type-approval pursuant to Article 3(4) of Directive 70/156/EEC of a type of rear fog lamp shall be submitted by the manufacturer.\n1.2. A model for the information document is given in Appendix 1.\n1.3. The following must be submitted to the technical service responsible for conducting the type-approval tests:\n1.3.1. Two samples, equipped with the lamp or lamps recommended; if the devices are not identical but are symmetrical and suitable for mounting one on the left and one on the right side of the vehicle, the two samples submitted may be identical and be suitable for mounting only on the right or only on the left side of the vehicle.\n2. MARKINGS\n2.1. The devices submitted for EC component type approval must bear:\n2.1.1. the trade name or mark of the manufacturer;\n2.1.2. in the case of lamps with replaceable light sources: the type(s) of filament lamp prescribed;\n2.1.3. in the case of lamps with non-replaceable light sources: the nominal voltage and wattage.\n2.2. These markings shall be clearly legible and indelible and shall be affixed to the illuminating surface, or to one of the illuminating surfaces, of the device. They shall be visible from the exterior when the device is fitted to the vehicle.\n2.3. Each device shall have sufficient space for the component type-approval mark. This space shall be indicated on the drawings referred to in Appendix 1.\n3. GRANTING OF EC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL\n3.1. If the relevant requirements are satisfied, EC type-approval pursuant to Article 4(3) and, if applicable, Article 4(4) of Directive 70/156/EEC shall be granted.\n3.2. A model for the EC type-approval certificate is given in Appendix 2.\n3.3. An approval number in accordance with Annex VII to Directive 70/156/EEC shall be assigned to each type of rear fog lamp approved. The same Member State shall not assign the same number to another type of rear fog lamp.\n3.4. Where EC component type approval is requested for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising a rear fog lamp and other lamps, a single EC component type-approval number may be assigned provided that the rear fog lamp complies with the requirements of this Directive and that each of the other lamps forming part of the lighting and light-signalling device for which EC component type approval is requested complies with the separate Directive applying to it.\n4. EC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL MARK\n4.1. In addition to the markings referred to in item 2.1., every rear fog lamp conforming to the type approved pursuant to this Directive shall bear an EC component type-approval mark.\n4.2.

In this Directive the sequence number is 00;\n4.2.3. an additional symbol consisting of the letter \"F\".\n4.3. The EC component type-approval mark shall be affixed to the lens of the lamp or one of the lenses in such a way as to be indelible and clearly legible even when the lamps are fitted to the vehicle.\n4.4. Examples of the EC component type-approval mark are given in Appendix 3, Figure 1.\n4.5. Where a single EC component type-approval number is issued, as per item 3.4. above, for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising a rear fog lamp and other lamps, a single EC component type-approval mark may be affixed, consisting of:\n4.5.1. a rectangle surrounding the letter \"e\" followed by the distinguishing number or letters of the Member State which has granted type approval (see item 4.2.1.);\n4.5.2. the base approval number (see item 4.2.2., first half-sentence);\n4.5.3. if necessary, the required arrow, in so far as it relates to the lamp assembly as a whole.\n4.6. This mark may be located anywhere on the lamps which are grouped, combined or reciprocally incorporated, provided that:\n4.6.1. it is visible after the installation of the lamps;\n4.6.2. no light-transmitting components of the grouped, combined or reciprocally incorporated lamps can be removed without simultaneously removing the approval mark.\n4.7. The identification symbol for each lamp corresponding to each Directive pursuant to which EC component type approval was granted, together with the sequence number (see item 4.2.2.) and, where necessary, the letter \"D\" and the required arrow shall be marked:\n4.7.1. either on the appropriate light-emitting surface;\n4.7.2. or in a group, in such a way that each of the grouped, combined or reciprocally incorporated lamps may be clearly identified.\n4.8.

In the case of modifications of the type approved pursuant to this Directive, the provisions of Article 5 of Directive 70/156/EEC shall apply.\n6. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION\n6.1. As a general rule, measures to ensure the conformity of production shall be taken in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 10 of Directive 70/156/EEC.\n6.2. Every rear fog lamp shall comply with the photometric conditions specified in paragraphs 6 and 9(1). Nevertheless, in the case of a rear fog lamp selected at random from series production, the requirements as to minimum intensity of the light emitted (measured with a standard lamp as referred to in paragraph 7(2)) shall be limited in each relevant direction to 80 per cent of the minimum value prescribed in paragraph 6(3).\n(1) Of the documents referred to in point 1 of Annex II to this Directive.\n(2) Of the documents referred to in point 1 of Annex II to this Directive.\n(3) Of the documents referred to in point 1 of Annex II to this Directive.\nAppendix 1\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.000702.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.000801.EPS\">\nAppendix 2\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.000902.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.001001.EPS\">\nAppendix 3\nEXAMPLES OF THE EC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL MARK\nFigure 1\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.001102.EPS\">\nThe device bearing the EC component type-approval mark shown above is a rear fog lamp, type approved in Germany (e1) pursuant to this Directive (00) under the base approval number 1471.\nFigure 2\nSimplified marking of grouped, combined or reciprocally incorporated lamps when two or more lamps are part of the same assembly\n(The vertical and horizontal lines schematise the shape of the light-signalling device.
