According to those criteria, exotic diseases are to have the potential for significant economic impact if introduced into the Union, either by production losses in Union aquaculture or by restricting the potential for trade in aquaculture animals and products thereof. Alternatively, they are to have potential for detrimental environmental impact if introduced into the Union, to wild aquatic animal populations of species, which are an asset worth protecting by Union law or international provisions.\n(4) On 15 September 2011, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Animal Health and Welfare adopted a Scientific Opinion on Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome\u00a0(2) (the EFSA opinion). In that opinion, the EFSA concludes that the impact of EUS in Union aquaculture would range from no impact to low impact.\n(5) In addition, the EFSA opinion states that it is likely that EUS has repeatedly entered into the Union via ornamental fish import from third countries and that such fish may have released into Union waters. Under these circumstances, and considering the fact that no outbreaks of EUS have been reported in the Union, there is no evidence to suggest that EUS has the potential for detrimental environmental impact.\n(6) In view of the EFSA conclusions and of the available scientific evidence, EUS does no longer meet the criteria set out in Part I of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC in order to be listed in Part II of that Annex.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to delete the entry for Epizootic ulcerative syndrome from the list of exotic diseases set out in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC.\n(8) In addition, Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC includes a list of species regarded as susceptible to Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia.\n(9) Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) is susceptible to the non-exotic fish disease Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia. Clinical outbreaks of that disease were confirmed in certain regions of Asia.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate to include Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) in the list of species susceptible to Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia set out in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC.\n(11) Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 1 January 2013 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
