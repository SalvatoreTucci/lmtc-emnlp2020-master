It also allows for the placing on the market of seal products where the hunt was conducted with the sole purpose of the sustainable management of marine resources and where the import of seal products are occasional in nature and consist exclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers and their families.\n(2) It is therefore necessary to specify detailed requirements for the import and the placing on the Union market of those seal products in order to ensure a uniform application of Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009.\n(3) The placing on the market of seal products which result from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities and which contribute to their subsistence should be allowed where such hunts are part of the cultural heritage of the community and where the seal products are at least partly used, consumed or processed within the communities according to their traditions.\n(4) The conditions for the placing on the market of seal products resulting from by-products of hunting that is conducted for the sole purpose of the sustainable management of marine resources, and for the importation of seal products for the personal use of travellers or their families, should also be laid down.\n(5) Within this exceptional framework, an effective mechanism to ensure an adequate verification of compliance with those requirements should be introduced. That mechanism should not be more trade-restrictive than necessary.\n(6) Other options would not be sufficient to achieve these aims. Therefore, a mechanism should exist by which recognised bodies issue documents attesting that seal products are compliant with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009, unless the import is for the personal use of travellers or their families.\n(7) It is appropriate to provide that entities which comply with certain requirements should be included in a list of recognised bodies issuing such attesting documents.\n(8) Models should be set out for the attesting document and its copies in order to facilitate the management and verification of attesting documents.\n(9) Procedures for the control of attesting documents should be set out. Those procedures should be as simple and as practical as possible, without compromising the credibility and consistency of the system.\n(10) The use of electronic systems should be allowed in order to facilitate the exchange of data between competent authorities, the Commission and the recognised bodies.\n(11) The processing of personal data for the purposes of this Regulation, in particular as regards the processing of personal data contained in attesting documents, should comply with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(2) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\n(12) Since this Regulation lays down detailed rules for the implementation of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 which applies on 20 August 2010, it should enter into force as a matter of urgency.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 18(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97\u00a0(4),", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down detailed rules for the placing on the market of seal products pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009.", "For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018other indigenous communities\u2019 means communities in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present State boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions;\n2. \u2018placing on the market on a non-profit basis\u2019 means placing on the market for a price less than or equal to the recovery of the costs borne by the hunter reduced by the amount of any subsidies received in relation to the hunt.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seal products resulting from hunts by Inuit or other indigenous communities may only be placed on the market where it can be established that they originate from seal hunts which satisfy all of the following conditions:\n(a) seal hunts conducted by Inuit or other indigenous communities which have a tradition of seal hunting in the community and in the geographical region;\n(b) seal hunts the products of which are at least partly used, consumed or processed within the communities according to their traditions;\n(c) seal hunts which contribute to the subsistence of the community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the time of the placing on the market, the seal product shall be accompanied by the attesting document referred to in Article 7(1).", "Seal products for the personal use of travellers or their families may only be imported where one of the following requirements is fulfilled:\n1. the seal products are either worn by the travellers, or carried or contained in their personal luggage;\n2. the seal products are contained in the personal property of a natural person transferring his normal place of residence from a third country to the Union;\n3. the seal products are acquired on site in a third country by travellers and imported by those travellers at a later date, provided that, upon arrival in the Union territory, those travellers present to the customs authorities of the Member State concerned the following documents:\n(a) a written notification of import;\n(b) a document giving evidence that the products were acquired in the third country concerned.\nFor the purposes of point 3, the written notification and the document shall be endorsed by the customs authorities and returned to the travellers.
