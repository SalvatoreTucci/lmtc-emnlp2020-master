Directive as last amended by Directive  92/53/EEC (OJ No L 225, 10. 8. 1992, p. 1).\nANNEX I\nREQUIREMENTS CONCERNING THE COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL OF TWO- OR THREE-WHEEL VEHICLES IN RESPECT OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR CONTROLS, TELL-TALES AND INDICATORS  1. DEFINITIONS\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n1.1. 'control' means any part of the vehicle or component directly actuated by the driver which causes a change in the state or operation of the vehicle or one of the parts thereof;\n1.2. 'telltale' means a signal indicating the triggering of a device, an operation or a suspect or faulty state or an absence of operation;\n1.3. 'indicator' means a device providing information on the proper functioning or state of a system or part of a system such as the level of a fluid;\n1.4. 'symbol' means an outline enabling a control, telltale or indicator to be identified.\n2. REQUIREMENTS\n2.1. Identification\nThe controls, tell-tales and indicators referred to in section 2.1.5 shall be identified in accordance with the following requirements when they are fitted to a vehicle.\n2.1.1. These symbols shall stand out clearly against the background, either bright against dark or dark against bright.\n2.1.2. The symbols shall be placed on the control or control telltale to be identified or in immediate proximity thereof. Where this is not possible the symbol and control, or telltale, shall be joined by a continuous dash that is as short as possible.\n2.1.3. Main-beam headlights shall be represented by parallel horizontal rays of light and dipped-beam headlamps by parallel rays of light angled downwards.\n2.1.4. When used for optical tell-tales the following colours listed below have the meanings indicated:\n- red: danger,\n- amber: caution,\n- green: safety.\nBlue shall be reserved exclusively for the main beam headlamp tell-tales.\n2.1.5. Designation and identification of symbols\nNotes:\n(1) The inside of the symbol may be entirely in a dark colour. (2) The dark part of this symbol may be replaced by its silhouette; the white part in this diagram may then be entirely in a dark colour. (3) If a single control is used for the front and  rear fog lamps the symbol used should be that for 'front fog lamp'.\nAppendix  Structure of the model base for the symbols referred to in section 2.1.5\nThe model base consists of:\n1. a base 50 mm square, this dimension being equal to nominal dimension 'a' in the original;\n2. a base circle 56 mm in diameter having approximately the same area as the base square (1);\n3. a second 50 mm-diameter circle is drawn within the base square (1);\n4. a second square the tips of which lie on the base circle (2) the sides of which are parallel to those of the base square (1);\n5. and\n6. two rectangles having the same area as the base square (1) their sides being at right angles to each other and each of them devised so as to divide the opposite sides of the base square into symmetrical points;\n7. a third square the sides of which pass through the points of intersection of the base square (1) and the base circle (2) and are inclined at 45\u00c2\u00b0, thus providing the greatest horizontal and vertical dimensions of the model base;\n8. an irregular octagon formed by lines inclined at 30\u00c2\u00b0 to the sides of the square (7).\nThe base model is laid upon a grid the lower side of which measures 12,5 mm and coincides with the base square (1).\nANNEX II\nAppendix 1  Information document in respect of the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators for a type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicle\n(to be attached to the application for component type-approval if this is submitted separately from the application for a vehicle type-approval)\nOrder No (assigned by the applicant):.\nThe application for a component type-approval in respect of the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators of a type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicle shall contain the information set out under the following points in Annex II to Council  Directive 92/61/EEC, Part A, sections:\n- 0.1\n- 0.2\n- 0.4 to 0.6.\nBrief description of the vehicle in respect of the identification of controls actuated by the driver, tell-tales and indicators.\nAppendix 2  Name of administration\nComponent type-approval certificate in respect of the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators for a type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicle\nMODEL\nReport No . by technical service . date .\nComponent type-approval No: . Extension No: .\n1. Make of vehicle: .\n2. Type of vehicle and any versions and variants: .\n3. Manufacturer's name and address: .\n.\n4.
