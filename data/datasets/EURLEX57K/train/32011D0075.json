However, that Directive permits derogations from that rule, provided that it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms.\n(2) Commission Decision 2003/249/EC\u00a0(2) authorises Member States to provide for temporary derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC to permit the import of plants of strawberry (Fragaria L.), intended for planting, other than seeds, originating in Chile.\n(3) The circumstances justifying the authorisation provided for in Decision 2003/249/EC are still present and there is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions.\n(4) By Commission Directive 2008/64/EC\u00a0(3)\nColletotrichum acutatum Simmonds was removed from point (c) of Section II of Part A of Annex II to Directive 2000/29/EC. Therefore this organism should no longer be included in the Annex of Decision 2003/249/EC.\n(5) Based on the experience gained with the application of Decision 2003/249/EC it is appropriate to extend the period of validity of that authorisation for 10 years.\n(6) Decision 2003/249/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/249/EC is amended as follows:\n1. the second paragraph of Article 1 of Decision 2003/249/EC is replaced by the following:\n2. the following Article 3a is inserted:\n3. the second indent of point 1(c) of the Annex is deleted.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 February 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 10.4.2003, p. 32.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 168, 28.6.2008, p. 31."}
