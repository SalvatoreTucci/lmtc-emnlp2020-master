For the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 34. (2) See page 28 of this Official Journal. (3) OJ No L 186, 30. 6. 1989, p. 23.\nANNEX I\nPROCEDURE FOR THE SAMPLING OF QUICK-FROZEN FOODS INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION\n1. Selection of packages for inspection\nThe type and quantity of packages selected shall be such that their temperature is representative of the warmest points of the consignment inspected.\n1.1. Cold-storage\nSamples should be selected from several critical points in the cold store, for example: near the doors (upper and lower levels), near the centre of the cold store (upper and lower levels), and near to the air return of the cooling unit. The duration of  storage of any products should be taken into account (for the stabilization of the temperature).\n1.2. Transport\n(a) Where it is necessary to select samples during transport:\nSelect from the top and the bottom of the consignment adjacent to the opening edge of each door or pair of doors.\n(b) Sampling during unloading:\nChoose four samples from amongst the following critical points:\n- top and bottom of the consignment adjacent to the opening edge of doors,\n- top rear corners of the consignment (at a point as far away from the refrigeration unit as possible),\n- centre of the consignment,\n- centre of the front surface of the consignment (as close as possible to the refrigeration unit),\n- top and bottom corners of the front surface of the consignment (as close as possible to the return air to the refrigeration unit).\n1.3. Retail display cabinets\nA sample must be selected for testing from each of three locations representative of the warmest points within the retail display cabinet used.\nANNEX II\nMETHOD OF MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE OF QUICK-FROZEN FOODSTUFFS INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION\n1. Scope\nUnder Article 1 (2) (1) of Directive 89/108/EEC the temperature throughout the product, following thermal stabilization, must be maintained at all times at a temperature of - 18\u00b0 C or colder with possible brief upward fluctuations as specified in Article  5 of the Directive.\n2. Principle\nMeasurement of the temperature of quick-frozen foodstuffs consists of accurately recording the temperature of a sample selected in accordance with Annex 1 by means of appropriate equipment.\n3. Definition of temperature\n'Temperature' means the temperature measured at the specified location by the temperature sensitive part of the measuring instrument or device.\n4. Apparatus\n4.1. Thermometric measuring device.\n4.2. Product-penetration instruments.\nA pointed metallic instrument shall be used such as an ice punch, a hand drill or an auger that is easy to clean.\n5. General specification for the temperature measuring instruments\nThe measuring instruments shall meet the following specifications:\n(a) the response time should achieve 90 % of the difference between the initial and final reading within three minutes;\n(b) the instrument must have an accuracy of \u00b1 0,5\u00b0 C within the measurement range  - 20\u00b0 C to + 30\u00b0 C;\n(c) the measuring accuracy must not be changed by more than 0,3\u00b0 C during operation in the ambient temperature range - 20\u00b0 C to + 30\u00b0 C;\n(d) the display resolution of the instruments should be 0,1\u00b0 C;\n(e) the accuracy of the instrument should be checked at regular intervals;\n(f) the instrument should have a current certificate of calibration;\n(g) the temperature probe should be capable of being easily cleaned;\n(h) the temperature-sensitive part of the measuring device must be so designed as to ensure good thermal contact with the product;\n(i) the electrical equipment must be protected against undesirable effects due to the condensation of moisture.\n6. Procedure for measurement\n6.1. Pre-cooling of instruments\nThe temperature measuring probe and the product penetration instrument should be pre-cooled before measuring the temperature of the product.\nThe pre-cooling method used should ensure that both instruments equilibrate as close to the product temperature as possible.\n6.2. Preparation af samples for temperature measurement\nTemperature measuring probes are not generally designed to penetrate a quick-frozen product. Therefore it is necessary to make a hole in the product in which to insert the probe by using the pre-cooled product penetration instrument. The diameter of the  holde should provide a close fit to that of the probe, and its depth will depend on the type of product (as described in 6.3).\n6.3. Measurement of product temperature\nThe sample preparation and its temperature measurement should be undertaken whilst the sample remains in the selected refrigerated environment. Measurement is as follows:\n(a) Where the product dimensions allow, insert the pre-cooled probe to a depth of 2,5 mm from the surface of the product;\n(b) Where (a) is not possible the probe should be inserted to a minimum depth from the surface of 3 to 4 times the diameter of the probe.\n(c) Certain foods, because of their size or composition (e.g. green peas) cannot be drilled to determine their internal temperature. In these cases, the internal temperature of the food package should be determined by insertion of a suitable pre-cooled  sharp-stemmed probe to the centre of the pack to measure the temperature in contact with the food.\n(d) Read the temperature indicated when it has reached a steady value."}
