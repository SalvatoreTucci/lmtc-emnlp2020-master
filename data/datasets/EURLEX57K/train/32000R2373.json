To that end Member States have notified the Commission of the land under fibre flax and hemp for which a crop declaration has been submitted for that marketing year in accordance with Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1164/89 of 28 April 1989 laying down detailed rules concerning the aid for fibre flax and hemp(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1313/2000(3). The notifications indicate that the declarations cover 125136 hectares of Community land under fibre flax and hemp.\n(3) If Member States are to approve aid for that land all the rules laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1164/89, including those relating to controls, must be complied with. However, fixing the aid amount from the crop declaration information communicated by the Member States does not prejudge the conclusions which may be drawn as a result of verification of the correctness of the information under the clearance of accounts procedure.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Flax and Hemp,", "main_body": ["For the 2000/2001 marketing year the amounts of aid referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 shall be:\n(a) EUR 795,46/ha for flax;\n(b) EUR 646,31/ha for hemp.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2000.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 October 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 16.\n(2) OJ L 121, 29.4.1989, p. 4.\n(3) OJ L 148, 22.6.2000, p. 34."}
