Due to those confirmed outbreaks of HPAI, the territory of Israel should no longer be considered as free from that disease. As a consequence, the veterinary authorities of Israel have suspended issuing veterinary certificates for consignments of certain poultry commodities from its whole territory destined for imports into the Union.\n(8) As a consequence of those HPAI outbreaks, Israel no longer complies with the animal health conditions for applying \u2018treatment A\u2019 to meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines for human consumption obtained from meat of poultry, farmed ratites and wild game birds as listed in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC. The current \u2018treatment A\u2019 is insufficient to eliminate animal health risks linked to those commodities and upon confirmation of HPAI, the veterinary authorities of Israel therefore immediately suspended certification for products having undergone such treatment.\n(9) Israel informed the Commission of the control measures taken in relation to the recent outbreaks of HPAI. That information and the epidemiological situation in Israel have been evaluated by the Commission.\n(10) Israel has implemented a stamping out policy in order to control that disease and limit its spread. Israel is also carrying out avian influenza surveillance activities which appear to meet the requirements set out in Part II of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008.\n(11) The positive outcome of the Commission\u2019s evaluation of the control measures taken by Israel and the epidemiological situation in that third country allow limiting the restrictions on imports into the Union for certain poultry commodities to the zone affected by the disease, which the veterinary authorities of Israel have placed under veterinary restrictions. The restrictions on those imports should apply during a three-month period until 22 June 2012, following adequate cleansing and disinfection of the previously infected holdings provided avian influenza surveillance has been carried out during that period by Israel.\n(12) The table in Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC lists the territories or parts of territories of third countries to which regionalisation for animal health reasons applies. An entry for Israel should therefore be inserted in that table indicating the area in Israel that is affected by the outbreaks of HPAI of 8 and 9 March 2012.\n(13) Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC should also be amended in order to provide for adequate treatment of meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines for human consumption obtained from meat of poultry, farmed ratites and wild game birds that originate from the area in Israel affected by those outbreaks.\n(14) In addition, the entry for Israel in the table in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should be amended to add an area with the code IL-4 describing that part of Israel under restrictions for imports into the Union of certain poultry commodities in relation to the recent HPAI outbreaks of 8 and 9 March 2012. The \u2018closing\u2019 and \u2018opening dates\u2019 of 8 March 2012 and 22 June 2012 respectively should be indicated in columns 6A and 6B for the area covered by that code.\n(15) Furthermore, following a previous HPAI outbreak in 2011, imports of certain poultry commodities from Israel to the Union were prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 427/2011\u00a0(6). The \u2018closing date\u2019 of 8 March 2011 indicated in column 6A for the area in Israel covered by code IL-3 in the table in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, relating to that outbreak should be deleted as the period of 90 days during which commodities produced before that date may be imported, has elapsed.\n(16) Decision 2007/777/EC and Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(17) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a018, 23.1.2003, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a074.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0312, 30.11.2007, p.\u00a049.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0139, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a055.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0226, 23.8.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0113, 3.5.2011, p.\u00a03.\nANNEX I\nAnnex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Part 1, the following new entry for Israel is inserted after the entry for China:\n\u2018Israel IL  Whole country\nIL-1 01/2012 The whole country of Israel, except the area of IL-2 with respect to highly pathogenic avian influenza.\nIL-2 01/2012 The area of Israel inside the following boundaries with respect to highly pathogenic avian influenza:\n\u2014 Junction of the Israel-Palestinian Authority (Gaza strip) border with the Israel-Egypt border.\n\u2014 South along the Israel-Egypt border until latitude 31\u00b0 06\u2032 N.\n\u2014 East on latitude 31\u00b0 06\u2032 N until longitude 34\u00b0 26\u2032 E.\n\u2014 A straight line north until the Nassi junction (junction of routes 264 and 25).\n\u2014 Route 264 north until the Bet Kama junction (junction of routes 264 and 40).\n\u2014 East on latitude 31\u00b0 27\u2032\u00a0N until longitude 34\u00b0 52\u2032 E.\n\u2014 North on longitude 34\u00b0 52\u2032\u00a0E until route 353.\n\u2014 Straight line until the meeting of route 40 and latitude 31\u00b0 40\u2032 N.\n\u2014 West on latitude 31\u00b0 40\u2032 N until the sea.\n\u2014 South along the Mediterranean coast until the Israel-Palestinian Authority (Gaza strip) border.\n\u2014 South along the Israel-Palestinian Authority (Gaza strip) border.\u2019\n(2) in Part 2, the entry for Israel is replaced by the following rows:\n\u2018IL Israel IL B B B B XXX XXX A B B XXX A XXX XXX\nIsrael IL-1 XXX XXX XXX XXX A A XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX A XXX\nIsrael IL-2 XXX XXX XXX XXX D D XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX D XXX\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, the entry for Israel is replaced by the following:\n\u2018IL \u2014 Israel IL-0 Whole country SPF\nEP, E       S4\nIL-1 Area of Israel excluding IL-2, IL-3 and IL-4 BPR, BPP, DOC, DOR, HEP, HER, SRP  N   A  S5, ST1\nWGM VIII\nPOU, RAT  N\nIL-2 Area of Israel inside the following boundaries:\n\u2014 to the west: road number 4,\n\u2014 to the south: road number 5812 connecting to road number 5815,\n\u2014 to the east: the security fence until road number 6513,\n\u2014 to the north: road number 6513 until the junction with road 65.
