An information shall be treated as confidential if the State which provides it so requests.\n2. After having consulted the Committee, the Commission shall prepare annual progress reports on the basis of the information supplied and shall forward them to the States. 3. At the end of the concertation period, the Commission shall, after having consulted the Committee, forward to the States, a general report on the execution and results of the project. This report shall be published by the Commission not later than six months after it has been forwarded, unless a State objects. In that case the report shall be treated as confidential and shall be forwarded, on the request and with the agreement of the Committee, solely to the institutions and undertakings whose research or production activities justify access to knowledge resulting from the performance of the research covered by the concerted action project.\nArticle 6\n1. This Agreement shall be open for signature by the Community and by the non-member States which took part in the Ministerial conference held in Brussels on 22 and 23 November 1971.\n2.
