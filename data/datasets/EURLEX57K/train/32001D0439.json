This differentiation of BEF 0,65 per litre is available to all users of these types of fuel.\n(3) Low-sulphur fuels comply with the environmental criterion (50 ppm) laid down in Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels(2). Under Articles 3 and 4 of that Directive, the use of 50 ppm fuels will, in principle, be compulsory from 1 January 2005.\n(4) The other Member States have been informed of this request by the Belgian authorities.\n(5) The measure envisaged by the Kingdom of Belgium complies with the minimum rates of excise duty referred to in Articles 4 and 5 of Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils(3).\n(6) The derogation is sought on environmental grounds - the benefits in terms of air quality are known.\n(7) Taking into account the information available at present, neither the Commission nor the Member States consider that the application of a differentiated rate of excise duty on low-sulphur fuel will cause distortions of competition affecting the common interest or hinder the operation of the single market.\n(8) This Decision does not prejudice the outcome of any future state aid procedures that may be undertaken in accordance with Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty, nor does it override the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential state aid to the Commission under Article 88 of the Treaty.\n(9) The Commission regularly reviews reductions and exemptions to check that they do not distort competition or the operation of the internal market or are incompatible with Community environmental policy.\n(10) The Council will review this decision on the basis of a proposal from the Commission no later than 31 December 2004, when the authorisation granted by this Decision expires,", "main_body": ["1.
