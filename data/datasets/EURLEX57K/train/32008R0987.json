Article 2(7)(a) of that Regulation provides that substances included in Annex IV are exempted from Titles II, V and VI of the same regulation as sufficient information is known about these substances that they are considered to cause minimum risk because of their intrinsic properties. In addition, Article 2(7)(b) of the same Regulation provides that substances covered by Annex V are exempted from the same titles of the Regulation, as registration is deemed inappropriate or unnecessary for these substances and their exemption from these titles does not prejudice the objectives of the Regulation.\n(2) Article 138(4) of that Regulation requires the Commission to review Annexes IV and V by 1 June 2008 with a view to proposing amendments, if appropriate.\n(3) The review carried out by the Commission pursuant to Article 138(4) has revealed that three substances listed in Annex IV should be removed from that Annex, as insufficient information is known about these substances for them to be considered as causing minimum risk because of their intrinsic properties. This is the case with vitamin A, as that substance may present significant risks of reproductive toxicity. This is also the case with carbon and graphite, in particular due to the fact that the concerned Einecs and/or CAS numbers are used to identify forms of carbon or graphite at the nano-scale, which do not meet the criteria for inclusion in this Annex.\n(4) Furthermore, three noble gases (helium, neon and xenon) fulfil the criteria for inclusion into Annex IV and should therefore be moved there from Annex V. Another noble gas, krypton, which meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex IV, should be added to the Annex for reasons of consistency. Three other substances (fructose, galactose and lactose) should be added because they have been identified as meeting the criteria for inclusion in Annex IV. Limestone should be deleted from Annex IV as it is a mineral and is already exempted in Annex V. Finally, certain existing entries on oils, fats, waxes, fatty acids and their salts should be deleted, as not all of those substances meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex IV and it is more consistent to include them in a generic entry in Annex V, using a formulation to limit the exemption to substances with a lower hazard profile.\n(5) The review carried out by the Commission pursuant to Article 138(4) of the Regulation has revealed that certain amendments should also be made to Annex V. Magnesia should be added, as it has been identified as a substance meeting the criteria for inclusion in Annex V. What is more, it is appropriate to add certain types of glass and ceramic frits which do not meet the classification criteria set out in Council Directive 67/548/EEC\u00a0(2) and which, in addition, do not have dangerous constituents above the relevant concentration limits, unless there is scientific data proving that these constituents are not available. Certain vegetable oils, fats and waxes and animal oils, fats and waxes, as well as glycerol, that are obtained from natural sources, which are not chemically modified and which do not have any hazardous properties beyond flammability and skin or eye irritancy, should be added to Annex V in order to provide a more consistent treatment of comparable substances and to limit the exemption to substances with lower hazard properties. The same applies to certain fatty acids, which are obtained from natural sources and which are not chemically modified and which do not have any hazardous properties beyond flammability and skin or eye irritancy. The addition of oils, fats, waxes and fatty acids in Annex V corresponds to the deletion of certain individual substances of these groups listed in Annex IV.\n(6) The amendments provided for in this Regulation, in particular compost and biogas, are without prejudice to Community legislation on waste.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is replaced by Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is replaced by Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 October 2008.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1; as corrected by OJ L\u00a0136, 29.5.2007, p.\u00a03.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 196, 16.8.1967, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX I\n\u2018ANNEX IV\nEXEMPTIONS FROM THE OBLIGATION TO REGISTER IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 2(7)(a)\nEinecs No Name/Group CAS No\n200-061-5 D-glucitol C6H14O6 50-70-4\n200-066-2 Ascorbic acid C6H8O6 50-81-7\n200-075-1 Glucose C6H12O6 50-99-7\n200-233-3 Fructose C6H12O6 57-48-7\n200-294-2 L-lysine C6H14N2O2 56-87-1\n200-334-9 Sucrose, pure C12H22O11 57-50-1\n200-405-4 \u03b1-tocopheryl acetate C31H52O3 58-95-7\n200-416-4 Galactose C6H12O6 59-23-4\n200-432-1 DL-methionine C5H11NO2S 59-51-8\n200-559-2 Lactose C12H22O11 63-42-3\n200-711-8 D-mannitol C6H14O6 69-65-8\n201-771-8 L-sorbose C6H12O6 87-79-6\n204-664-4 Glycerol stearate, pure C21H42O4 123-94-4\n204-696-9 Carbon dioxide CO2 124-38-9\n205-278-9 Calcium pantothenate, D-form C9H17NO5.1/2Ca 137-08-6\n205-756-7 DL-phenylalanine C9H11NO2 150-30-1\n208-407-7 Sodium gluconate C6H12O7.Na 527-07-1\n215-665-4 Sorbitan oleate C24H44O6 1338-43-8\n231-098-5 Krypton Kr 7439-90-9\n231-110-9 Neon Ne 7440-01-9\n231-147-0 Argon Ar 7440-37-1\n231-168-5 Helium He 7440-59-7\n231-172-7 Xenon Xe 7440-63-3\n231-783-9 Nitrogen N2 7727-37-9\n231-791-2 Water, distilled, conductivity or of similar purity H2O 7732-18-5\n232-307-2 Lecithins 8002-43-5\n232-436-4 Syrups, hydrolyzed starch 8029-43-4\n232-442-7 Tallow, hydrogenated 8030-12-4\n232-675-4 Dextrin 9004-53-9\n232-679-6 Starch 9005-25-8\n232-940-4 Maltodextrin 9050-36-6\n238-976-7 Sodium D-gluconate C6H12O7.xNa 14906-97-9\n248-027-9 D-glucitol monostearate C24H48O7 26836-47-5\n262-988-1 Fatty acids, coco, Me esters 61788-59-8\n265-995-8 Cellulose pulp 65996-61-4\n266-948-4 Glycerides, C16-18 and C18-unsaturated. 67701-30-8\n268-616-4 Syrups, corn, dehydrated 68131-37-3\n269-658-6 Glycerides, tallow mono-, di- and tri-, hydrogenated 68308-54-3\n270-312-1 Glycerides, C16-18 and C18-unsaturated, mono- and di- 68424-61-3\n288-123-8 Glycerides, C10-18 85665-33-4\u2019\nANNEX II\n\u2018ANNEX V\nEXEMPTIONS FROM THE OBLIGATION TO REGISTER IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 2(7)(b)\n1.
