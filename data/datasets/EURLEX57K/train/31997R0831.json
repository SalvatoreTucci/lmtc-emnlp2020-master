DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to avocados of varieties (cultivars) grown from Persea americana Mill. to be supplied fresh to the consumer, parthenocarpic fruit and avocados for industrial processing being excluded.\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements of avocados after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the avocados must be:\n- intact,\n- sound, produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter,\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n- free of damage caused by low temperature,\n- having a stalk not more than 10 mm in length which must be cut off cleanly. However, its absence is not considered a defect on condition that the place of the stalk attachment is dry and intact,\n- free of abnormal external moisture,\n- free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\nAvocados must be carefully picked. Their development should have reached a physiological stage which will ensure a continuation of the ripening process to completion. The ripe fruit should be free from bitterness.\nThe development and condition of the avocados must be such as to enable them:\n- to withstand transport and handling, and\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB. Classification\nAvocados are classified in three classes defined below:\n(i) 'Extra` Class\nAvocados in this class must be of superior quality. In shape and colouring they must be characteristic of the variety.\nThey must be free from defects, with the exception of very slight superficial defects of the skin provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package. If present, the stalk must be intact.\n(ii) Class I\nAvocados in this class must be of good quality and show the typical colour and shape of the variety.\nThe following slight defects, however, may be allowed provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package:\n- slight defects of shape and colour,\n- slight skin defects (corkiness, healed lenticels) and sunburn; the maximum total area should not exceed 4 cm\u00c2\u02db.\nIn no case may the defects affect the fruit flesh.\nThe stalk, if present, may be slightly damaged.\n(iii) Class II\nThis class includes avocados which do not qualify for inclusion in the higher classes but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\nThe following defects may be allowed provided the avocados retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, the keeping quality and presentation:\n- defects in shape and colouring,\n- skin defects (corkiness, healed lenticels) and sunburn: the maximum total area should not exceed 6 cm\u00c2\u02db.\nIn no case may the defects affect the fruit flesh.\nThe stalk, if present, may be damaged.\nIII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING\nSize is determined by the weight of the fruit; the size scale is as follows:\n>TABLE>\nThe minimum weight of avocados must not be less than 125 g.\nIV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES\nTolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements for the class indicated.\nA. Quality tolerances\n(i) 'Extra` Class\n5 per cent by number or weight of avocados not satisfying the requirements of avocados but meeting those of class I or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances of that class.\n(ii) Class I\n10 per cent by number or weight of avocados not satisfying the requirements of the class but meeting those of Class II or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerance of that class.\n(iii) Class II\n10 per cent by number or weight of avocados satisfying neither the requirements of the class nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of fruit affected by rotting, marked bruising or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\nB. Size tolerances\nFor all classes: 10 % by number or weight of avocados conforming to the size range immediately below and/or above that mentioned in the marking.\nV.
