Table 3.1 lists the harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances based on the criteria set out in Parts 2 to 5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Table 3.2 lists the harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances based on the criteria set out in Annex VI to Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances\u00a0(2). Those two lists need to be amended to include updated classifications for substances already subject to those harmonised classifications and to include new harmonised classifications.\n(2) The Committee for Risk Assessment of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has issued opinions on proposals for harmonised classification and labelling of substances which had been submitted to ECHA pursuant to Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Based on those opinions, as well as on the comments received from the parties concerned, it is appropriate to amend Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 in order to harmonise the classification and labelling of certain substances.\n(3) The harmonised classifications set out in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as amended by this Regulation, should not apply immediately, as a certain period of time will be necessary to allow operators to adapt the labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures to the new classifications and to sell existing stocks. In addition, a certain period of time will be necessary to allow operators to comply with the registration obligations resulting from the new harmonised classifications for substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, categories 1A and 1B (Table 3.1) and categories 1 and 2 (Table 3.2), or as very toxic to aquatic organisms which may cause long term effects in the aquatic environment, in particular with those set out in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC\u00a0(3).\n(4) In line with the transitional provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 which allow the application of the new provisions at an earlier stage on a voluntary basis, suppliers should have the possibility of applying the harmonised classifications set out in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as amended by this Regulation, and of adapting the labelling and packaging accordingly on a voluntary basis before 1 December 2013.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,", "main_body": ["Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) Table 3.1 is amended as follows:\n(a) The entries corresponding to the entries set out in Annex I are replaced by the entries set out in that Annex;\n(b) The entries set out in Annex II are inserted in accordance with the order of the entries set out in Table 3.1.\n(2) Table 3.2 is amended as follows:\n(a) The entries corresponding to the entries set out in Annex III are replaced by the entries set out in that Annex;\n(b) The entries set out in Annex IV are inserted in accordance with the order of the entries set out in Table 3.2.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "shall apply from 1 December 2013.\nThe harmonised classifications set out in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as amended by this Regulation, may be applied before 1 December 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 196, 16.8.1967, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 136, 29.5.2007, p. 3.\nANNEX I\nIndex No International Chemical Identification EC No CAS No Classification Labelling Specific Conc.
