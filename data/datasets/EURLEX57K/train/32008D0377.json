Those measures should continue to apply in Slovakia.\n(6) The animal health conditions and the certification requirements for trade in live pigs are laid down in Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine\u00a0(5).\n(7) The animal health conditions and certification requirements for trade in porcine semen are laid down in Council Directive 90/429/EEC of 26 June 1990 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the porcine species\u00a0(6).\n(8) The animal health conditions and certification requirements for trade in porcine ova and embryos are laid down in Commission Decision 95/483/EC of 9 November 1995 determining the specimen certificate for intra-Community trade in ova and embryos of swine\u00a0(7).\n(9) Commission Decision 2002/106/EC of 1 February 2002 approving a Diagnostic Manual establishing diagnostic procedures, sampling methods and criteria for evaluation of the laboratory tests for the confirmation of classical swine fever\u00a0(8) provides for risk adapted surveillance protocols.\n(10) Based on the information provided by Slovakia it appears that classical swine fever might have spread already to herds in several areas of that Member State before the outbreaks were discovered. Appropriate investigations to trace, confirm or infirm new infections require sufficient time viewing the nature of the disease. It is therefore appropriate to review the protective measures relating to classical swine fever in Slovakia. In the context of these precautionary measures, it is in particular also appropriate to specify in which cases and under which conditions the transport of pigs may be authorised to Member States and within the territory of Slovakia to prevent the spread of the disease.\n(11) Decision 2008/303/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The measures provided for in this Decision shall apply without prejudice to the measures provided for in:\n(a) Directive 2001/89/EC, and in particular Articles 9, 10 and 11 thereof;\n(b) Decision 2006/805/EC.", "Slovakia shall ensure that no pigs are dispatched to other Member States and to third countries, unless the pigs:\n(a) come from a holding situated in an area ouside the areas listed in the Annex;
