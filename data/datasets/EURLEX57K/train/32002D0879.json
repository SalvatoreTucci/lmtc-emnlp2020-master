The programme hereby provides for specific eradication measures for VHS in the affected coastal areas, with the final view to obtaining approved zone status as regards VHS and IHN for all continental and coastal areas of Finland. The programme includes non-discriminatory restrictions on movements of fish in order to prevent re-introduction of the diseases in question.\n(3) The amended programme submitted complies with the appropriate requirements of Directive 91/67/EEC.\n(4) The amended programme submitted by Finland should therefore be approved and Decision 2002/304/EC amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2002/304/EC is replaced by the Annex hereto.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 November 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 46, 19.2.1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 189, 3.7.1998, p. 12.\n(3) OJ L 104, 20.4.2002, p. 37.\nANNEX\n\"ANNEX I\nZONES IN WHICH APPROVED PROGRAMMES ARE APPLIED WITH A VIEW TO OBTAINING THE STATUS OF APPROVED ZONE WITH REGARD TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FISH DISEASES VHS AND IHN\n1.
