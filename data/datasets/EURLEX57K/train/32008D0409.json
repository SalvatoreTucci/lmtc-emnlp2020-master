Decision XVII/10 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption of the controlled substance listed in Annex E of the Montreal Protocol necessary to satisfy laboratory and analytical uses of methyl bromide.\n(6) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free MDIs, all Member States have notified\u00a0(2) the United Nations Environment Programme the active ingredients for which chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of CFC-MDIs for placing on the market of the European Community.\n(7) Article 4(4)(i)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFCs from being used and placed on the market unless they are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1) of that Regulation. These non-essentiality determinations have therefore reduced the demand for CFCs used in MDIs that are placed on the market of the European Community. In addition, Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1).\n(8) The Commission has published a Notice\u00a0(3) on the 18 July 2007 to those companies in the Community of 27 Member States that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2008 and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances for 2008.\n(9) For the purpose of ensuring that interested companies and operators may continue to benefit in due time from the licensing system, it is appropriate that the present decision shall apply from 1 January 2008.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group I (chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 which may be used for essential medical uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 155\u00a0460,00 ozone-depleting potential (ODP) kilograms.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group I (chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115) and Group II (other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 which may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 56\u00a0213,60 ODP kilograms.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group III (halons) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory use in the Community in 2008 shall be 418,7 ODP kilograms.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group IV (carbon tetrachloride) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 150\u00a0832,836 ODP kilograms.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group V (1,1,1-trichloroethane) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the European Union in 2008 shall be 381,5 ODP kilograms.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group VI (methyl bromide) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for laboratory and analytical uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 150,00 ODP kilograms.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group VII (hydrobromofluorocarbons) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 0,96 ODP kilograms.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of group IX (bromochloromethane) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 13,368 ODP kilograms.", "The chlorofluorocarbon metered-dose inhalers listed in Annex I shall not be placed on markets where the Competent Authority has determined chlorofluorocarbons for metered-dose inhalers on those markets to be non-essential.", "During the period 1 January to 31 December 2008 the following rules shall apply:\n1.
