In the last case they have to be excluded from classification under heading 2009 and have to be classified under heading 2106.\n(4) In accordance with Additional Note 5(b) to Chapter 20 of the Combined Nomenclature, fruit juices to which so much sugar has been added that they contain less than 50\u00a0% by weight of fruit juice have lost their natural state of fruit juice and can therefore not be classified under heading 2009. The added sugar content is to be determined according to their Brix value which depends, amongst others, on the sugar content of these products.\n(5) Problems have risen with respect to the classification of concentrated natural fruit juices. When the added sugar content of those products is calculated as set out in Additional Notes 2 and 5, it may appear to be so high that products contain less than 50\u00a0% by weight of fruit juices so that they have to be classified under heading 2106. This result is unsatisfactory as it is based on a fictive calculation of the added sugar content while in reality no sugar has been added and the high added sugar content results from the concentration.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to reword point (b) of Additional Note 5 to Chapter 20 and to add a new provision to that point, clearly stating that for concentrated natural fruit juices the criterion of 50\u00a0% by weight of fruit juices does not apply so that those juices are not to be excluded from heading 2009 on the basis of a calculated addition of sugar. It should also be clearly stated that Additional Note 5 is to be applied on the products as presented.\n(7) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Additional note 5 to Chapter 20 of the Combined Nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is replaced by the following text:\n\u20185.
