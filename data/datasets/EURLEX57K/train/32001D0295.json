CLINICAL EXAMINATION\n1.1. Holdings must undergo clinical examinations of all animals of susceptible species for signs or symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease.\n1.2. Special emphasis must be laid on animals which may have been exposed to foot-and-mouth disease virus with a high probability, notably transport from holdings at risk or close contact to persons or equipment that had close contact to holdings at risk.\n1.3. The clinical examination must take into account the transmission of foot-and-mouth disease and the way in which animals of susceptible species are kept.\n1.4. Relevant records kept on the holding must be examined in detail with particular regard to data on morbidity, mortality and abortion, clinical observations, changes in productivity and feed intake, purchase or sale of animals, visits of persons likely to be contaminated and other anamnesticly important information.\n2. PROCEDURES FOR SAMPLING\n2.1. Serological sampling shall be carried out according to the recommendations of the epidemiological team established within the framework of the contingency plans, and shall without prejudice to the requirements in paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 support the provision of evidence for the absence of previous infection.\nThe measures applicable to holdings where sheep and goats are kept may equally apply to holdings where other susceptible animals are kept taking into account the recommendations of the epidemiological team.\n2.2. All holdings within the perimeters of the zone where sheep and goats have not been in direct and close contact with bovine animals during a period of at least 21 days prior to taking the samples shall be examined following a sampling protocol suitable to detect at least 5 % prevalence of disease with at least 95 % certainty.\n2.3. Holdings within the perimeters of the zone where the presence of foot-and-mouth disease in the absence of clinical signs must be suspected, notably where sheep and goats are kept, shall be examined. For the purpose of this survey the model of a multi-stage sampling shall be sufficient which must ensure that samples are taken:\n2.3.1. from holdings in all administrative units within the perimeters of the zone where sheep and goats have not been in direct and close contact with bovine animals during a period of at least 30 days prior to taking the samples, and\n2.3.2. from as many holdings of those referred to in point 2.3.1 as necessary to detect with 95 % certainty at least one infected holding if the estimated prevalence of the disease was 2 % equally distributed throughout the zone (maximum 150 holdings), and\n2.3.3. from as many sheep and goats per holding as necessary to detect at least 5 % prevalence of disease within the herd with at least 95 % certainty, but not more than 60 samples per holding and from all sheep and goats if there are less than 15 sheep and goats on the holding.\n2.4. Actions will commence when at least 21 days have elapsed after the elimination of susceptible animals on the infected holding(s) and the carrying out of preliminary cleansing and disinfection."}
