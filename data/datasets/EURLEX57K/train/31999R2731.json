Experience has shown that the applications submitted for each tranche relate to a total quantity far exceeding that available and thus result in the issue of licences for reduced quantities. There are therefore grounds for tightening up the conditions under which applications are submitted so that they are submitted by operators who are commercially engaged in the import or export of rice. The amount of the security in respect of the licence should also be increased.\n(2) Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2603/97 allows operators to withdraw applications for licences where a reduction percentage is applied. In the light of experience, there are grounds for limiting withdrawal of applications to cases where the application of a reduction percentage would result in the issue of an import licence for a quantity that is not economically viable.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2603/97 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
