The ICTY has the power to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. The Security Council argued that the widespread and flagrant violations of humanitarian law occurring within the territory of the former Yugoslavia constituted a threat to international peace and security and that the establishment, as an ad hoc measure, of an international tribunal and the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law would contribute to the restoration and maintenance of peace.\n(2) On 28 August 2003, UN Security Council Resolution 1503 (2003) called on the ICTY to complete all work in 2010 and on all States to intensify cooperation with and render all necessary assistance to the ICTY, particularly to bring all fugitive indictees to the ICTY.\n(3) Common Position 2004/694/CFSP stipulates that certain funds and economic resources should be frozen in support of effective implementation of the mandate of the ICTY. These additional restrictive measures should be used so as to control all dealings with funds and economic resources owned by persons indicted by the ICTY who are still at large and to ban any support they might receive from within the Community.\n(4) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, in order to avoid any distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement these measures as far as the Community is concerned. For the purposes of this Regulation, the territory of the Community should be deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty.\n(5) For reasons of expediency, the Commission should be empowered to amend the Annexes to this Regulation.\n(6) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication,\n(7) The Treaty, in Articles 60 and 301, empowers the Council to take, under certain conditions, measures aimed at the interruption or reduction of payments or movement of capital and of economic relations with regard to third countries. The measures laid down in this Regulation, targeted at individual persons not directly linked to the government of a third country, are necessary to attain this objective of the Community and Article 308 of the Treaty empowers the Council to take such measures if no other specific powers are provided for in the Treaty,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018funds\u2019 means financial assets and benefits of every kind, including but not limited to:\n(a) cash, cheques, claims on money, drafts, money orders and other payment

will be used exclusively to satisfy claims secured by such a lien or recognised as valid in such a judgment, within the limits set by applicable laws and regulations governing the rights of persons having such claims;\n(c) The lien or judgment is not for the benefit of a person, entity or body listed in Annex I;\n(d) Recognising the lien or judgment is not contrary to public policy in the Member State concerned.\nThe relevant competent authority shall inform the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission of any authorisation granted under this Article.", "Article 2(2) shall not apply to the addition to frozen accounts of:\n(i) interest or other earnings on those accounts; or\n(ii) payments due under contracts, agreements or obligations that were concluded or arose

not prevent the crediting of the frozen accounts by financial institutions that receive funds transferred by third parties to the account of the listed person or entity, provided that any such
