The specification states that the link between the cheese \u2018D\u017eiugas\u2019 and its area is expressed by its specific method of production that confers physical, chemical and organoleptic characteristics that can not be found in other cheeses. The specification furthermore claims that the production method of cheese \u2018D\u017eiugas\u2019 determines its higher content of magnesium and calcium and that the particular organoleptic characteristics of the cheese \u2018D\u017eiugas\u2019, its faint yellow colour with greyish nuances and its fresh taste, are due to its method of production. In the absence of a link between these factors and the geographical origin, the application does not meet the basic criteria for registration as a protected geographical indication.\n(5) A link within the meaning of the second indent of Article 2(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 has therefore not been demonstrated.\n(6) In the light of the above, the application to register the name \u2018D\u017eiugas\u2019 as a protected geographical indication should be rejected.\n(7) The measure provided for in this Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,", "main_body": ["The application to register the name \u2018D\u017eiugas\u2019 is hereby rejected.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Lithuania."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a093, 31.3.2006, p.\u00a012."}
