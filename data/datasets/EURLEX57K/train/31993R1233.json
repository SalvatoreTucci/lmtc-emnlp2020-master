whereas management measures covering the importing of such animals should be laid down;\nWhereas experience shows that limiting exports may lead to speculative import licence applications; whereas, in order to ensure that the contemplated measures function properly, the greater part of the quantities available should be set aside for so-called traditional importers of cows and heifers of certain mountain breeds; whereas, in order to avoid forcing trade relations in this product group into an excessively rigid mould, a second tranche should be made available for operators capable of demonstrating that they are engaged in genuine trade of some scale with third countries; whereas, in this connection and in order to ensure efficient management, the operators concerned must be required to have imported at least 15 head in the period 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996; whereas a batch of 15 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and whereas experience shows that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered genuine and viable; whereas verification of these criteria requires all applications from the same operator to be submitted in the same Member State;\nWhereas steps must be taken to ensure that importers in the first category in the new Member States can participate fairly in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas the reference quantities to be used to determine such operators' access to the quantities set aside for traditional importers should be the quantities they imported from 1 July 1993 to 31 December 1994 from countries regarded as third countries from their viewpoint at 31 December 1994 and the quantities they imported from 1 January 1995 to 30 June 1996 under the same type of quota;\nWhereas, in order to prevent speculation, operators no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 July 1996 should be denied access to the quota;\nWhereas provision should be made for the arrangements to be administered by means of import licences; whereas, to that end, detailed rules should be laid down in particular on the submission of applications and on the information to appear in applications and in licences, where appropriate, by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95 (4), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2856/95 (6); whereas provision should also be made for the licences to be issued after a delay for reflection and, where necessary, subject to the application of a single percentage reduction;\nWhereas Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (7), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at reduced rate on account of their end-use; whereas the animals imported should be monitored to ensure they are not slaughtered during a certain period; whereas a security should be required to ensure compliance with the requirement for the animals not to be slaughtered;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.

Applicants may submit only one application and that application shall relate to one part of the quota only.\nWhere applicants submit more than one application, all applications from such applicants shall be deemed inadmissible.\n3. For the purposes of Article 2 (1) (a), with their applications for import rights operators shall present the proof referred to in Article 2 (4) to the competent authorities by 17 July 1996 at the latest.\nAfter verifying the documents presented, by 31 July 1996 at the latest, Member States shall send the Commission a list of operators who meet the conditions for admissibility, showing in particular their names and addresses and the number of animals imported in the period referred to in Article 2 (2).\n4. For the purposes of Article 2 (1) (b), applications for import rights must be lodged by operators, together with the proof referred to in Article 2 (4), by 17 July 1996 at the latest.\nAfter verifying the documents presented, by 31 July 1996 at the latest the Member States shall send the Commission a list of applicants and of the quantities applied for.\n5. All notifications, including notifications of nil applications, shall be made by telex or fax using the forms set out in Annexes IV and V.", "1. The Commission shall decide what percentage of quantities covered by applications may be accepted.\n2. As regards applications as referred to in Article 4 (4), where the quantities covered by applications exceed those available, the Commission shall reduce the quantities applied for by a fixed percentage.\nWhere the reduction referred to in the first subparagraph gives fewer than 15 heads per application, the quantities shall be allocated by the Member States concerned by drawing lots, by batches of 15 head. Where fewer than 15 head remain, a single licence shall be issued for that quantity.", "1. Imports of the quantities allocated shall be subject to presentation of an import licence.\n2. Import licence applications may only be submitted to the competent authorities in Member States where the applicants are entered in a national VAT register.\n3. Following notifications of allocation from the Commission, import licences shall be issued as soon as possible on application by and in the names of the operators who have obtained import rights. Licences shall be issued subject to the lodging by the applicants of a security of ECU 25 per head of cattle.\nSuch securities shall be released immediately when licences are returned to the issuing authority, bearing endorsements by the customs authorities certifying import of the animals.\n4. Import licences shall be valid for 90 days from the date of actual issue. They shall expire, however, on 31 December 1996 at the latest.\n5. Licences issued shall be valid throughout the Community.\n6. Without prejudice to this Regulation, Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 and (EC) No 1445/95 shall apply.\nHowever, Article 8 (4) and the second subparagraph of Article 14 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 shall not apply.", "1.
