Lead is required as a stabiliser in the processing of the PVC for the sensor cards. Although research of substitutes is ongoing, a suitable alternative is not yet available. The performance of tested alternatives both to lead in PVC and to PVC itself does not meet the specific technical requirements.\n(3) Both the substitution of lead in PVC sensor cards for in-vitro diagnostic medical devices for blood, body fluid and body gas analysis and the elimination of lead via substitution of PVC in these applications are technically impracticable.\n(4) The use of lead in PVC sensors for blood, body fluid and body gas analysis used in in-vitro diagnostic medical devices should therefore be exempted until 31 December 2018. In view of the innovation cycles for medical devices this is a short transition period which is unlikely to have adverse impacts on innovation.\n(5) Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2011/65/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the last day of the ninth month after entry into force at the latest.
