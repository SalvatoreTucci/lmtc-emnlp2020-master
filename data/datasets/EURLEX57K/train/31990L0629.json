This provision shall not apply to vehicles for which, according to item  4.3, lap belts only for front outboard seating positions are allowed. If anchorages . . .`.\n(Remainder unchanged)\nItem 4.3 is replaced by the following:\n'4.3.\nMinimum number of belt anchorages to be provided (see Appendix 1).\n4.3.1.\nAny vehicle in categories M and N (except those vehicles which include places specially designed  for standing passengers in categories M2 over 3,5 tonnes and M3) must be equipped with safety belt  anchorages which satisfy the requirements of this Directive.\n4.3.2.\nThe minimum number of safety belt anchorages for each forward directed seating position shall be as  specified in Appendix 1.\n4.3.3.\nHowever, for outboard seating positions - other than front - of vehicles of the category M1, shown  in Appendix 1 and marked with the symbol oe, two lower anchorages are allowed, where there exists a  passage between a seat and the nearest side wall of the vehicle intended to permit access of  passengers to other parts of the vehicle. A space between a seat and the side wall is considered as  a passage, if the distance between that side wall, with all doors closed, and a vertical  longitudinal plane passing through the centreline of the seat concerned - measured at the R-point  position and perpendicularly to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle - is more than 500  mm.\n4.3.4.\nFor the front centre seating positions shown in Appendix 1 and marked with the symbol *, two lower  anchorages shall be considered adequate where the windscreen is located outside the reference zone  defined in Annex II to Directive 74/60/EEC; if located inside this reference zone, three anchorages  are required.\nAs regards belt anchorages, the windscreen is considered as part of the reference zone when it is  capable of entering into static contact with the test apparatus according to the method described  in Annex II to Directive 74/60/EEC.\n4.3.5.\nFor all seating positions shown in Appendix 1 and marked with the symbol ll=, each exposed seating  position, as defined in item 4.3.6, must be equipped with two lower anchorages.\n4.3.6.\nAn \"exposed seating position'` is one where there is no \"protective screen'' in front of the seat  within the following defined space:\n- between two horizontal planes, one through the H-point and the other 400 mm above it,\n- between two vertical longitudinal planes which are symmetrical in relation to the H-point and are  400 mm apart,\n- behind a transverse vertical plane 1,30 m from the H-point.\nFor the purposes of this requirement \"protective screen'' means a surface of suitable strength and  showing no discontinuities such that, if a sphere of 165 mm diameter is geometrically projected in  a longitudinal horizontal direction through any point of the space defined above and through the  centre of the sphere, nowhere in the protective screen is there any aperture through which the  geometrical projection of the sphere could be passed.\nA seat is considered to be an \"exposed seating position'', if the protective screens within the  space defined above have a combined surface area of less than 800 cm$.\n4.3.7.\nFor all folding seats, as well as all the seats of any vehicle which are not covered in items 4.3.1  to 4.3.5, no belt anchorages are required. However, if the vehicle is fitted with anchorages for  such seats, these anchorages must comply with the provisions of this Directive.\nIn this case, two lower anchorages shall be sufficient.'\nItem 4.4.3 reads as follows:\n'4.4.3.\nLocation of the effective lower belt anchorages (see Apendix 2)\n4.4.3.1.\nFront seats, vehicle-category M1\nIn motor vehicles of category M1 the angle  \u00e11 (other than buckle  side) shall be within the range of 30 to 80g and the angle \u00e12 (buckle side) shall be within the  range of 45 to 80g.
