whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 504/97 of 19 March 1997 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the system of production aid for products processed from fruit and vegetables (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1590/98 (4), lays down general rules applicable to that system; whereas certain detailed rules should be laid down specifically for prunes, without prejudice to the other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 504/97;\nWhereas fruit can be of variable quality; whereas the minimum price and the production aid should be fixed for a specified marketing class, the amounts applicable for the other classes should be derived from that class and these classes should be defined taking into account, for the amounts so derived, the characteristics of the different classes;\nWhereas the aim of the minimum quality requirements referred to in Article 4(4)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 is to avoid the production of products for which no demand exists or products which would create distortion of the market; whereas those requirements must be based on traditional, fair manufacturing procedures; whereas, to ensure compliance with these provisions, the minimum characteristics required of dried plums purchased by processors and prunes qualifying for aid should be defined;\nWhereas this Regulation incorporates the provisions specific to prunes in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1709/84 of 19 June 1984 on minimum prices payable to producers and amounts of production aid for certain processed fruit and vegetables eligible for production aid (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1591/98 (6), and in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2022/85 of 22 July 1985 on minimum quality requirements for dried plums and prunes eligible for production aid (7), updating those provisions in line with legal, technical and economic developments and experience gained;

Minimum quality requirements for dried plums\nI. MINIMUM CHARACTERISTICS\n1. Dried plums must be of sound and fair merchantable quality and fit for processing.\n2. Dried plums must have a maximum moisture content of 23 %, except for fruit intended for the production of semi-dry prunes, which must have a moisture content of between 30 and 35 %.\n3. Dried plums must be of a size corresponding to less than 105 plums per 500 g, except for fruit intended for the production of semi-dry prunes the size of which must correspond to less than 81 plums per 500 g.\n4. The fruit must be:\n(a) well dried, sound, that is to say, free from mould, rot, insects, whether live or dead, and insect excrement;\n(b) fleshy, clean and free from dirt;\n(c) free from foreign smell and taste;\n(d) practically free from defects and waste.\nII. TOLERANCES\nThe following tolerances are allowed:\n1. Dried plums for industrial uses\n(a) 0,3 % by weight of waste\n(b) 100 % of fruit with slight and/or serious defects\n(c) 10 % by weight of fruit with very serious defects\n(d) 5 % of fruit of a size corresponding to 105 plums or more per 500 g\n2. Other dried plums\n(a) 0,2 % by weight of waste\n(b) 0,5 % by weight of fruit with very serious defects\n(c) 7,5 % by weight of fruit with serious or very serious defects\n(d) 15 % by weight of fruit with defects\nIII. DEFECTS\nDefects fall into three categories:\n- slight defects, which are minor defects of the skin,\n- serious defects, which are mainly serious defects of the skin,\n- very serious defects, which are mainly defects where the flesh has been damaged.\nThe following definitions shall apply:\n1. Slight defects\n(a) Terminal cracks or fissures\nFissures in the skin more than 10 mm but not more than 15 mm in length at the end opposite the stem cavity.\n(b) Small skin perforations\nTorn, damaged or missing skin, either over an area equal to or less than 7 mm long but more than 3 mm wide with the flesh not emerging from the lesion or over an area more than 7 mm long but less than 3 mm wide with the flesh remaining visible.\n(c) Lesions due to hail, of an aggregate area exceeding 3 mm in diameter\nScars caused by hail of an aggregate area not exceeding 10 mm in diameter.\n(d) Grey patches, russeting or scabs, of an aggregate area exceeding 6 mm in diameter\nThis defect consists of a hard thickening of the skin, making patches of various shapes of an aggregate area not exceeding 20 mm in diameter.\n2. Serious defects\n(a) Consistency defect\nThis effect is usually due to insufficient ripening, resulting in defective colouring and soft flesh with a skin characterised by numerous shallow wrinkles.\n(b) Cracks due to bursting\nNon-terminal cracks due to bursting of the fruit, followed by healing with hard excrescences, over a length exceeding 10 mm.\n(c) Terminal cracks\nCracks at the apex exceeding 15 mm in length.\n(d) Perforations\nTorn, damaged or missing skin over an area larger than indicated for classification as a slight defect.\n(e) Partly crushed fruit\nPartly crushed fruit, parts of fruit or markedly misshapen fruit with the flesh in evidence.\n(f) Lesions due to hail\nLesions due to hail, with scars over an aggregate area exceeding 10 mm in diameter.\n(g) Grey patches, russeting or scabs\nThick hard patches over an aggregate area exceeding 20 mm in diameter.\n(h) Fissures\nSkin fissures more than 15 mm in length opposite the stem cavity or deep fissures revealing the kernel.\n(i) Deformation due to sun scorch\nSevere deformation due to sun scorch, resulting in the virtual absence of flesh on part of one side of the fruit, with the skin adhering unwrinkled to the kernel.\n3. Very serious defects\n(a) Caramelised fruit\nFruit caramelised by too much heat, showing very dark colouring of the flesh or gaps between the kernel and flesh.\n(b) Monilia-attacked fruit\nFruit with light patches caused by Monilia attack, arrested by drying, with damaged skin.\n(c) Soiled fruit\nFruit soiled by the presence of foreign matter (especially earth) which could be removed.\n(d) Completely crushed fruit\nCompletely crushed fruit or parts of fruit.\n4. Waste\nThe term 'waste` is used to mean any material that may not, because of its nature or condition, be offered for human consumption or that, if it remained mixed with the fruit whatever its end-use, might:\n- reduce its keeping qualities,\n- impair its appearance,\n- transmit unacceptable taste, odour or other defects to it.\nThe following are regarded as 'waste`:\n(a) Fruit bearing active mould\nFruit bearing mould which is spreading.\n(b) Moniliated-mummified fruit\nIndividual fruits or fruits which are compacted or welded together, the pulp having been destroyed and mummified by the complete development of Monilia.\n(c) Rotten fruit\nFruit whose edibility is impaired or destroyed by micro-organisms (yeasts, moulds, bacteria).\n(d) Fruit infested by insects and mites\nFruits infested by live or dead animal pests (insects and mites at any stage in their biological cycle) or by insect excrement.\n(e) Fruit encrusted with earth or other soil constituents\n(f) Burnt fruit\nFruit burnt by excessive heat, showing gaps between the flesh and kernel, or characteristic swelling giving the shape of fresh plums.\n(g) Foreign matter\nIndividual inedible parts of the fruit, such as stems, kernels and skin fragments, and foreign bodies or matter such as leaves, twigs and other plant matter, soil constituents such as earth or stones.\nPart B: Minimum quality requirements for prunes\nI. MINIMUM CHARACTERISTICS\n1. Prunes must be obtained from dried plums with the characteristics set out in Part A.\n2. Prunes must have a maximum moisture content of 23 %, except for semi-dry prunes, which must have a moisture content of between 30 and 35 %.\n3. Prunes must be sorted and size-graded unless intended for industrial use.\n4. Prunes must be:\n- intact, sound, fleshy, clean, free from mould, rot and waste,\n- practically free from blemish liable to impair the quality or appearance of the product,\n- free from insects, whether live or dead, and insect excrement,\n- free from abnormal smell and taste,\n- of a size corresponding to less than 105 prunes per 500 g, with the exception of semi-dry prunes, for which the number of fruit must be less than 81 prunes per 500 g.\nII. TOLERANCES\n1. Prunes for industrial uses\n(a) 100 % of fruit with slight and/or serious defects\n(b) 10 % by weight of fruit with very serious defects\n(c) 5 % of fruit of a size corresponding to 105 prunes or more per 500 g\n2. Semi-dry prunes\n(a) 0,3 % by weight of fruit with very serious defects\n(b) 5 % by weight of fruit with serious or very serious defects\n(c) 10 % by weight of fruit with defects\n3. Other prunes\n(a) 0,5 % by weight of fruit with very serious defects\n(b) 7,5 % by weight of fruit with serious or very serious defects\n(c) 15 % by weight of fruit with defects\nIII. DEFECTS\nPart A is applicable for determining the seriousness of the defects.\nANNEX II\n>TABLE>\nFor dried plums and prunes intended for industrial uses irrespective of their size, the coefficient to be applied is 0,4000."}
