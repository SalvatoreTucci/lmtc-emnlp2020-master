Commission Regulation (EC) No 1356/2004\u00a0(3) authorised that additive for 10 years for use for chickens for fattening, chickens reared for laying and turkeys, linking the authorisation to the person responsible for putting that additive into circulation. That additive was notified as an existing product on the basis of Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Since all the information required under that provision was submitted, that additive was entered into the Community Register of Feed Additives.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility of modifying the authorisation of an additive further to a request from the authorisation holder and an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority). The holder of the authorisation of the additive monensin sodium (Elancoban G100, Elancoban 100, Elancogran 100, Elancoban G200, Elancoban 200) has submitted an application which proposes changing the terms of the authorisation by introducing maximum residue limits (MRLs) as evaluated by the Authority.\n(3) In its opinion adopted on 21 November 2006, the Authority proposed to establish provisional MRLs for the active substance concerned\u00a0(4). It may be necessary to review the MRLs set out in the Annex in the light of the results of a future evaluation of that active substance by the European Medicines Agency.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1356/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1356/2004 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 February 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
