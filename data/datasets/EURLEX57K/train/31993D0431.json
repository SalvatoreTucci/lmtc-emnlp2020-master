Key Criteria  These criteria are based on the major environmental impacts as highlighted in the cradle-to-grave assessment. The threshold levels must all be achieved in order to qualify for an eco-label.\n(i) Energy Consumption\nStandard size models (10 or more place settings)\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 0,125 kWh of electrical energy per place setting in an IEC 436 test.\nSlimline and compact models (less than 10 place settings)\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 0,15 kWh of electrical energy per place setting in an IEC 436 test.\n(ii) Water Consumption\nStandard size models (10 or more place settings)\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 1,85 litres of water per place setting in an IEC 436 test.\nSlimline and compact models (less than 10 place settings)\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 2,25 litres of water per place setting in an IEC 436 test.\nB. Best practice criteria  Best practice criteria relate to features of a dishwasher which make a smaller contribution to the overall environmental impact of the product. The qualifying levels for these criteria reflect best environmental practice. All  of these criteria must be achieved in order to qualify for an eco-label.\n(i) User instructions\n1. The machine must have clear markings on it identifying the settings appropriate according to the type of load (e.g. glass, china, pots and pans, crockery) and degree of soil.\n2. Where dry heat boost is provided, it must be an option; it should not occur automatically.\n3. On the machine there must be clear instructions to use a full load wherever possible.\n4. Clear instructions must be made available to the consumer providing:\n- advice on varying the detergent dosing according to the degree of soil,\n- advice on varying the salt dosing according to water hardness,\n- advice on the machine installation which makes the most appropriate use of the hot and cold fill, if available on the machine, including advice based on the fuel used for home water heating,\n- advice to avoid rinsing items before placing them in the dishwater,\n- advice on the best use of the rinse and hold option, if available,\n- advice on the best use of the dry heat boost option, if available,\n- information about the energy consumption of the machine for different programmes and with and without dry heat boost,\n- information about the water consumption of the machine for different programmes and options,\n- advice about te machine being made of materials which are recyclable and that it houd be disposed of accordingly.\n(ii) Encouragement to recycling\nWhere they occur in components in quantities greater than 50 g the following polymeric materials must have a permanent marking identifying the material:\n- polypropylene,\n- polystyrene,\n- PVC,\n- HDPE,\n- LDPE,\n- ABS,\n- polyamide,\n- other.\nThe marking must use the symbols or abbreviated terms given in ISO 1043.\nC. Performance criteria  (i) Wash performance\nThe machine must achieve at least a minimum wash efficiency of 85 % in an IEC 436 test.\n(ii) Drying efficiency\nThe machine must achieve at least a minimum drying efficiency of 70 % in an IEC 436 test."}
