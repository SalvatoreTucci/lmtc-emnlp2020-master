Accordingly, in order to prevent the spread of that disease and contribute to its eradication, the Community should contribute to eligible expenditures incurred by Germany. It is therefore appropriate that a financial contribution from the Community should be granted to Germany under the provisions of Decision 90/424/EEC in order to cover the costs related to the outbreak of avian influenza in 2003.\n(3) It is necessary to clarify the concepts of \"swift and adequate compensation of the livestock farmers\" and \"destruction, cleaning, disinfection and disinsectisation costs\" used in Article 3 (2) of Decision 90/424/EEC and the concepts of \"reasonable payments\" and \"justified payments\" mentioned in the present Decision.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agriculture policy(4), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules are to be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. For financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(5) Having regard to the uncertainty on the final eligible amount needed to compensate the outbreak of the disease, the financial contribution at this stage should be limited to an advance of EUR 135000, for the eligible costs incurred for the obligatory culling of the animals and the obligatory destruction of the eggs.\n(6) The financial contribution from the Community should be granted provided that the actions planned are carried out efficiently and that the competent authorities supply all the necessary information within the time limits laid down in this Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Payment of a financial contribution from the Community to Germany\nGermany may obtain a financial contribution from the Community of 50 % of the eligible expenditure for:\n(a) the swift and adequate compensation of the owners for their animals killed and their eggs destroyed pursuant to Article 10 of Council Directive 90/425/EEC(5) and Article 5 of Directive 92/40/EEC, under compulsory eradication measures mentioned the first and seventh indent of Article 3(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC, related to outbreaks of avian influenza which occurred in 2003, and in accordance with the present Decision;\n(b) the costs of the destruction of carcasses, eggs, contaminated feedingstuffs and equipment, the cleaning, disinsectisation and disinfection of holdings and equipment, mentioned in under the first, second and third indents of Article 3(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC, and in accordance with the present Decision.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \"swift and adequate compensation\" means payment, within 90 days:\n- of the culling of the animals, for compensation corresponding to the market value as defined in Article 3(1),\n- of the destruction of the eggs, for compensation corresponding to the market value as defined in Article 3(1);\n(b) \"reasonable payments\" means payments for the purchase of materials or services at proportionate prices compared to the market prices before the outbreak of the avian influenza;\n(c) \"justified payments\" means payments for the purchase of materials or services of which the nature and the direct link with the compulsory culling of animals or the destruction of the eggs, as referred to in Article 1(a) is demonstrated.", "The eligible expenditure covered by the financial contribution from the Community\n1.
