The denunciation took effect for Bolivia on 1 January 2012.\n(2) Bolivia has subsequently deposited an instrument to re-accede the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs with a reservation on the traditional use of coca leaves (in particular chewing and medicinal uses). This request for re-accession is currently under assessment by the State Parties.\n(3) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 provides for the temporary withdrawal of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance referred to in Section 2 of Chapter II of that Regulation, in particular if the national legislation no longer incorporates those conventions referred to in Annex III which have been ratified in fulfilment of the requirements of Article 8(1) and (2) or if that legislation is not effectively implemented. This arrangement was granted to Bolivia by Commission Decision 2008/938/EC\u00a0(2).\n(4) The UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs is listed in Annex III, Part B, point 24, to Regulation (EC) No 732/2008.\n(5) Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 provides that where the Commission receives information that may justify temporary withdrawal and where it considers that there are sufficient grounds for an investigation it shall inform the Generalised Preferences Committee and request consultations. Pursuant to Article 17(2), following consultations the Commission may decide to initiate an investigation\n(6) It is necessary to analyse the effects of the denunciation of that Convention to determine whether they justify a temporary withdrawal of the special incentive arrangement.
