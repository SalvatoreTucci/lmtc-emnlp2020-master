However, it is appropriate for certain supplementary information required for implementing certain provisions of the Schengen Convention correctly to be exchanged bilaterally or multilaterally. Such supplementary information is needed in particular in relation to the action required pursuant to Articles 25, 39, 46, 95 to 100, 102(3), 104(3), 106, 107, 109 and 110 of the Schengen Convention. The exchange of this supplementary information is carried out by the Sirene offices of each Member State.\n(3) The Sirene Manual is a set of instructions to operators in the Sirene offices of each of the Member States which describes in detail the rules and procedures governing the bilateral or multilateral exchange of such supplementary information.\n(4) Uniformity of the Sirene Manual should be ensured. The Schengen technical acquis should be applicable here.\n(5) Amendments to Part 1 of the Sirene Manual pursuant to this Decision should be confined to reflecting the applicable version of the provisions of the Schengen Convention.\n(6) It is necessary to establish a procedure for amending the Sirene Manual in accordance with the relevant provisions of the various Treaties.\n(7) The legislative basis required for allowing future amendments to the Sirene Manual consists of two separate instruments: this Decision based on Articles 30(1)(a) and (b), 31(a) and (b) and 34(2)(c) of the Treaty on European Union and Council Regulation (EC) No 378/2004 of 19 February 2004 on procedures for amending the Sirene Manual(4) based on Article 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The reason for this is that, as set out in Article 92 of the Schengen Convention, the SIS is to enable the authorities designated by the Member States, by means of an automated search procedure, to have access to alerts on persons and property for the purposes of border checks and other police and customs checks carried out within the country in accordance with national law, as well as for the purposes of issuing visas, residence permits and the administration of legislation on aliens in the context of the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the movement of persons. The exchange of the supplementary information required for implementing the provisions of the Schengen Convention referred to in recital 2, carried out by the Sirene offices of each Member State, also serves these purposes, as well as assisting with police cooperation generally.\n(8) The fact that the legislative basis required consists of two separate instruments does not affect the principle that the SIS constitutes, and should continue to constitute, one single, integrated, information system and that the Sirene offices should continue to carry out their tasks in an integrated manner.\n(9) This Decision sets out procedures for the taking of measures necessary for its implementation which mirror the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 378/2004, so as to ensure that there will be one single implementing process for the amendment of the Sirene Manual as a whole.\n(10) An arrangement should be made to allow representatives of Iceland and Norway to be associated with the work of committees assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers. Such an arrangement has been contemplated in the Exchange of Letters between the Community and Iceland and Norway(5), annexed to the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(6).\n(11) This Decision and the United Kingdom's and Ireland's participation in its adoption and application are without prejudice to the arrangements for the United Kingdom's and Ireland's partial participation in the Schengen acquis defined by the Council in Decisions 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(7) and 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(8), respectively.\n(12) This Decision constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the Act of Accession,", "main_body": ["The Sirene Manual shall constitute a set of instructions to operators in the Sirene offices of each Member State which establishes the rules and procedures governing the bilateral or multilateral exchange of supplementary information which is required in order to implement correctly certain provisions of the Schengen Convention, as integrated into the framework of the European Union.", "1.
