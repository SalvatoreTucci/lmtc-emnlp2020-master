That test needs further independent evaluation and eventual validation in order that the Commission may approve it in the framework of Directive 2001/89/EC, if appropriate.\n(6) It is appropriate that such evaluation is carried out by the Community reference laboratory in cooperation with the national reference laboratories in the Member States.\n(7) Intervet is to provide, free of charge, the national swine fever laboratories in the Member States and the Community reference laboratory with an adequate amount of reagents which are necessary for the evaluation of the new test.\n(8) For financial assistance to the Community reference laboratory for classical swine fever for 2003 the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 324/2003 of 20 February 2003 establishing the eligibility criteria for the expenditure of the Community reference laboratories receiving financial assistance under Article 28 of Decision 90/424/EEC and establishing the procedures for the submission of expenditure and the conduct of audits(5) should apply.\n(9) It is appropriate to financially support the relevant work of the Community reference laboratory, as it may contribute to the development of Community legislation on classical swine fever and to a better control of the disease.\n(10) Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(6), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules are to be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; for financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.
