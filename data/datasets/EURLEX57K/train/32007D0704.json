The review investigation confirmed that the company had serious problems in classifying the different product types properly and in accordance with the terms of the undertaking. This was partly due to accounting system limitations which did not allow them to properly distinguish between different SWR product types. Similar problems were already identified during the monitoring of the undertaking and led to a warning letter.\n(11) It has therefore been concluded that the undertaking in its current form is no longer workable.\n(12) On this basis and in accordance with the relevant clauses of the undertaking, which authorise the Commission to unilaterally withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking, the Commission has decided to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking.\n(13) The Commission informed the Russian authorities and the Russian exporting producer concerned that it proposed to withdraw the acceptance of the current undertaking.
