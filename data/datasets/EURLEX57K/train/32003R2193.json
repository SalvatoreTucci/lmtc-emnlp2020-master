On 29 January 2002, the DSB adopted the panel and appellate body reports which established that the above Act also constituted a prohibited export subsidy under the WTO and that it did not amount to withdrawal of the FSC subsidy. Consequently, on 7 May 2003, the Community was authorised by the DSB to impose countermeasures up to a level of USD 4043 million in the form of additional 100 % ad valorem duties on certain products originating in the United States of America.\n(3) It is considered that, initially, the imposition in stages of additional import duties of up to a 17 % ad valorem on imports of selected products originating in the United States of America is an appropriate countermeasure, in view of the failure of the United States of America to implement the DSB recommendations. After the abovementioned level of additional duties is reached, the Commission should present a proposal to the Council for further action in the light of developments.\n(4) In respect of these selected products, the tariff concessions of the Community should be suspended from 1 March 2004. The suspension of tariff bindings should be temporary and only be applied until such time as the WTO inconsistent measure has been removed. The origin of any product to which this Regulation applies should be determined in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(2).\n(5) Products for which an import licence with an exemption from, or a reduction of, duty has been issued prior to the date of entry into force of this Regulation should not be subject to these additional customs duties.\n(6) Products for which it can be proved that they have been exported from the United States of America to the Community prior to the date of first application of the additional customs duties should not be subject to these additional customs duties.\n(7) Products affected by the suspension of concessions should be placed under the customs procedure \"processing under customs control\" in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(3) only pursuant to an examination in the Committee of the Customs Code,", "main_body": ["The tariff concessions of the Community are hereby suspended as from 1 March 2004 in respect of products originating in the United States of America listed in the Annex to this Regulation.", "1.
