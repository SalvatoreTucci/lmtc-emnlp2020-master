By Implementing Regulation (EU) No 723/2011\u00a0(3), the Council extended these measures to certain iron or steel fasteners consigned from Malaysia (\u2018the extended measures\u2019) with the exception of imports produced by certain companies specifically mentioned.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUEST FOR A REVIEW\n(2) The European Commission (\u2018the Commission\u2019) has received a request for an exemption pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation from the anti-dumping measures extended to imports of certain iron or steel fasteners consigned from Malaysia. The application was lodged by Andfast Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (\u2018the applicant\u2019), a producer in Malaysia (\u2018the country concerned\u2019).\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRODUCT\n(3) The product under examination is certain iron or steel fasteners, other than of stainless steel, i.e. wood screws (excluding coach screws), self-tapping screws, other screws and bolts with heads (whether or not with their nuts or washers, but excluding screws turned from bars, rods, profiles or wire, of solid section, of a shank thickness not exceeding 6\u00a0mm and excluding screws and bolts for fixing railway track construction material), and washers, consigned from Malaysia, currently falling within CN codes ex\u00a07318\u00a012\u00a090, ex\u00a07318\u00a014\u00a091, ex\u00a07318\u00a014\u00a099, ex\u00a07318\u00a015\u00a059, ex\u00a07318\u00a015\u00a069, ex\u00a07318\u00a015\u00a081, ex\u00a07318\u00a015\u00a089, ex\u00a07318\u00a015\u00a090, ex\u00a07318\u00a021\u00a000 and ex\u00a07318\u00a022\u00a000 (\u2018product concerned\u2019).\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW\n(4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the European Union during the investigation period used in the investigation that led to the extended measures, i.e. 1 January 2008 to 30 September 2010.\n(5) Furthermore, the applicant alleges that it is not related to exporting producers subject to measures, and that it has not circumvented the measures applicable to certain iron or steel fasteners of Chinese origin.\n(6) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Union after the end of the investigation period used in the investigation that led to the extended measures.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(7) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment.\n(8) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation for the purposes of determining the possibility of granting the applicant an exemption from the extended measures.\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questionnaires\nIn order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of information and holding of hearings\nAll interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS\n(9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the European Union by the applicant.\n(10) At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the examination result in a finding of circumvention in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this examination. The amount of the applicant\u2019s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(11) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION\n(12) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(13) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(14) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(4).\nJ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(15) It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade.
