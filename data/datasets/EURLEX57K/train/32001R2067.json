The production zones were designated in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2138/97(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1979/2001(6). Taking into account the figures received, the yields should be fixed as laid down in the Annex.\n(2) Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 648/2001(8), lays down a method for estimating yields in homogenous zones that takes account of the overall statistical results obtained on the basis of samples at the level of larger regional areas. The statistical results for France, in view of its modest production levels, are obtained on the basis of a single regional area and a small sample that does not permit an accurate national figure to be obtained. Adjustment of the yields of the homogenous zones on the basis of the statistical results as provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 produced clearly inconsistent values for the 2000/01 marketing year. The yields of the homogenous zones in France should therefore be fixed without making the adjustment concerned.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["For the 2000/01 marketing year, the olive yields and oil yields shall be as set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 November 2000.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 October 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.\n(2) OJ L 201, 26.7.2001, p. 4.\n(3) OJ L 208, 3.8.1984, p. 3.\n(4) OJ L 210, 28.7.1998, p. 38.\n(5) OJ L 297, 31.10.1997, p. 3.\n(6) OJ L 270, 11.10.2001, p. 12.\n(7) OJ L 293, 31.10.1998, p. 50.\n(8) OJ L 91, 31.3.2001, p. 45.\nANEXO/BILAG/ANHANG/\u03a0\u0391\u03a1\u0391\u03a1\u03a4\u0397\u039c\u0391/ANNEX/ANNEXE/ALLEGATO/BIJLAGE/ANEXO/LIITE/BILAGA\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>"}
