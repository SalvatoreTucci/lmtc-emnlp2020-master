whereas, to that end, all producers must submit aid applications giving certain minimum information permitting such verification; whereas provision should be made for such verification to be conducted in particular by an on-the-spot sampling check of a sufficiently representative number of aid applications; whereas, to the same end, the particulars to be notified to the Commission by the Member States should be specified;\nWhereas special provisions should be laid down to cover cases of false declarations by producers;\nWhereas, to simplify the operation of the scheme, it should be provided that Member States are to apply a system similar to that instituted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1164/89 of 28 April 1989 laying down detailed rules concerning the aid for fibre flax and hemp\u00a0(3);\nWhereas uniform provisions should be laid down for the payment of the aid;\nWhereas the operative event creating entitlement to the aid for hemp occurs when the hemp is produced; whereas, however, it is very difficult to establish the exact date of production of a given lot; whereas experience has shown that production is almost entirely completed during the month of August of each year at the latest; whereas, in order to ensure uniform operation of the aid scheme, the conversion rate used to calculate the amounts of the aid in national currency should be the rate applicable at the end of that month;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Regulation, \u2018indicative yield\u2019 means the yield per hectare of hemp seed fixed, during a particular marketing year, in respect of one or more homogeneous production areas.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When fixing the indicative yield, account shall be taken of the yields which are representative of the general trend revealed by sampling checks carried out by the Member States in the main production areas.\nSuch sampling checks shall be conducted at holdings and shall relate to a representative percentage of the areas under hemp, having regard to the geographical distribution of those areas.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 136/66/EEC\u00a0(4) one or more homogeneous production areas shall be established each year after the harvest by reference to the factors influencing production conditions, and on the basis in particular of those regions which are representative as regards the areas harvested.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aid shall be granted in respect only of areas:\n(a) the whole of which has been sown and harvested;
