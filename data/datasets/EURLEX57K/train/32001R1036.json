Honduras has been given extra time to prove that it is complying with conservation and management measures. In consequence, the result of the country's measures will be reviewed at the 2001 annual meeting.\n(6) ICCAT has recommended the Contracting Parties to take appropriate measures to prohibit imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna products originating in Belize, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Honduras. These measures will be lifted as soon as it is established that the countries in question have brought their fishing practices into line with ICCAT's measures. These measures must be implemented by the Community, which has sole competence in this matter.\n(7) In the case of Atlantic bigeye tuna products originating in Honduras, ICCAT's prohibition will enter into force on 1 January 2002, unless the country can provide documentary proof at ICCAT's 2001 meeting that its fishing activities have been brought into line with ICCAT's management and conservation measures.\n(8) These measures are compatible with the Community's obligations under other international agreements,", "main_body": ["1.
