For large-scale production, that company now intends to modify the specification as regards purity. It has submitted data to show that the modified specification fulfils the requirements for inclusion.\n(3) Germany evaluated the information and data submitted by the company. It informed the Commission in July 2005 that it concludes that the modified specification does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the entry for propoxycarbazone in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and in the Commission review report for that substance.\n(4) Therefore it is justified to modify the specification of propoxycarbazone.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 18 September 2006 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
