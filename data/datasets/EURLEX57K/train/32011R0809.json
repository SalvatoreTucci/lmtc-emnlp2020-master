However, Article 15(3) of that Regulation provides that when fishery products inter alia are imported directly from a freezer vessel, that document may be replaced by a document signed by the captain.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down implementing measures for certain products under Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and for the organisation of official controls under Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, derogating from Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004\u00a0(3) set outs model health certificates, including one for imports of fishery products, in Annex VI thereto.\n(4) Member States and stakeholder organisations have requested the Commission to establish a model document to be signed by the captain in order to harmonise the information requested and procedures applied when frozen fishery products are imported into the Union directly from a freezer vessel.\n(5) The model document to be signed by the captain should specifically refer to the provisions relevant for handling of fishery products as laid down in Section VIII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 on board freezer vessels. The model document should also fit into the electronic system for exchange of health certificates and import documents between the National Competent Authorities for health issues in relation to live animals and products of animal origin (TRACES).\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to establish a harmonised model document to be signed by the captain when fishery products are imported into the Union directly from a freezer vessel. Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 6 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Annex VI is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 August 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 206.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 338, 22.12.2005, p. 27.\nANNEX\nAnnex VI to Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 is amended as follows:\n(1) The title of Annex VI and Sections I to VI are replaced by the following:\n(2) The following Appendix VII is added:"}
