This derogation was granted taking into account the discussions in an ad hoc expert meeting on risk management activities under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and the results of the study on Socio-Economic Impact of a Potential Update of the Restrictions on the Marketing and Use of Cadmium in jewelleries, brazing alloys and PVC, published in January 2010\u00a0(4). All elements of the restriction were also subject to consultation with the Member States\u2019 competent authorities responsible for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and with stakeholders.\n(3) Following the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 494/2011, the Commission was informed of uses of cadmium pigments in certain types of plastics materials, restricted for the first time by Regulation (EU) No 494/2011, where suitable alternatives to the use of cadmium compounds appear not to be available and for which, due to the exceptional circumstances of a limited consultation, further assessment is now appropriate.\n(4) The Council Resolution of 25 January 1988 calls for an overall strategy to combat environmental pollution by cadmium, including specific measures to restrict the use of cadmium and stimulate the development of further alternatives to the use of cadmium in pigments, stabilisers and plating, asking for limitation of the uses of cadmium to cases where suitable alternatives do not exist.\n(5) The Commission will ask the European Chemicals Agency, in accordance with Article 69 of REACH, to prepare a dossier conforming to the requirements of Annex XV relating to the use of cadmium and cadmium compounds in those types of plastic material that were restricted for the first time by Regulation (EU) No 494/2011, taking full account of the Council Resolution of 25 January 1988.\n(6) Until the restriction procedure is finalised, the restriction on the use of cadmium and its compounds should be limited to the types of plastic material listed in entry 23 of Annex XVII before the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 494/2011.\n(7) For reasons of legal certainty, this Regulation should apply from 10 December 2011.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,", "main_body": ["Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 10 December 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 September 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 134, 21.5.2011, p. 2.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 149, 14.6.2008, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/chemicals/files/markrestr/study-cadmium_en.pdf\nANNEX\nIn Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the table setting out the designation of the substances, groups of substances and mixtures and the conditions of restriction is amended as follows:\n(1) in the second column of entry 23, the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph 1 are replaced by the following:\nMixtures and articles produced from plastic material as listed above shall not be placed on the market if the concentration of cadmium (expressed as Cd metal) is equal to or greater than 0,01\u00a0% by weight of the plastic material.\u2019\n\u20181.
