Pursuant to Directive 96/23/EC, the inclusion and retention on the lists of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import animals and primary products of animal origin covered by that Directive, are subject to submission by the third countries concerned of a plan setting out the guarantees which they offer as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in that Directive.\n(2) Commission Decision 2004/432/EC of 29 April 2004 on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC\u00a0(2) lists those third countries which have submitted a residue monitoring plan, setting out the guarantees offered by them in compliance with the requirements of that Directive.\n(3) Serbia has presented residue monitoring plans to the Commission for animals and products of animal origin not currently listed in Decision 2004/432/EC. The evaluation of those plans and the additional information obtained by the Commission provide sufficient guarantees on the residue monitoring in that third country for the animals and products concerned. The relevant animals and products of animal origin should therefore be included in the list for Serbia in that Decision.\n(4) Greenland, Namibia and Paraguay have asked not to be included in the list in Decision 2004/432/EC for certain categories of animals and products of animal origin. The entries concerning the relevant animals and products of animal origin should therefore be deleted from the list for those third countries.\n(5) Costa Rica and Vietnam, which are currently listed for certain animals or products of animal origin under Decision 2004/432/EC, have not submitted to the Commission the requested guarantees for some of these animals and products of animal origin. Moreover Food and Veterinary Office inspections in those third countries have revealed serious deficiencies concerning the residue monitoring for the animals and products concerned. The entries for the relevant animals and products of animal origin for those third countries should therefore be deleted in the list. The third countries concerned have been informed accordingly.\n(6) A transitional period should be laid down to cover consignments of animals and products originating in Costa Rica, Greenland, Namibia, Paraguay and Vietnam which were dispatched from those third countries for the Community, before the date of application of this Decision, to cover the time needed for their arrival in the Community.\n(7) Decision 2004/432/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "The amendments to the list in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC by the present Decision shall not apply to consignments of animals and products originating in Costa Rica, Greenland, Namibia, Paraguay and Vietnam where the importer of such products can demonstrate that they had been dispatched from the third country concerned and were en route to the Community before the date of application of the present Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 May 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 125, 23.5.1996, p. 10.
